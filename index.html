<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Golden Age of Botanical Art. Martyn Rix</h2><p>From some of the earliest attempts at art to the plant hunters of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the images produced in the study of plants have held a fascination for all those who love nature. The Golden Age of Botanical Art brings together the stories of the intrepid explorers (some of whom became botanical artists by default) and the many professional artists who recorded the flora that they discovered on their travels and expeditions. Truly global in its scope, this beautifully illustrated book moves across centuries and continents looking at the artistry of China and India, delving into the sketchbooks of explorers in the Himalayas and following the voyages of those who discovered new worlds and new species as far apart as Russian and South America. Alongside special features on key figures in the botanical art world, the book highlights the work of some of the great names of botanical art, including Ehret and Bauer. The Golden Age of Botanical Art includes a host of rarely, or previously unpublished, images, and shows how what might have been a pastime for some also made a significant contribution to our understanding of the world and the glories of nature.</p><p>Martyn Rix is a botanist and the Editor of Curtis&#39;s Botanical Magazine, and as such has an unrivalled knowledge of botanical art. With a PhD in Botany from the University of Cambridge, he has worked at the University Botanic Garden in Zurich and at the RHS Garden, Wisley and has made many expeditions to different parts of the world, to collect new plants for gardens. He is the author or co-author of a number of books, including the highly acclaimed The Botanical Garden.</p><h2>Hayagriva: Horse Cult in Asia</h2><p>Growing interest in tantric Buddhism worldwide has resulted in an explosion of literature on the subject; despite this, there still remain many voids in our understanding of this complex practice, with its proliferation of gods and saints, bodhisattvas and demons.R. H. van Gulik was one of the pioneer Western scholars of the tantric deities, having completed a highly acclaimed doctorate on the subject of the tantric god, Hayagriva, in 1935, with the dissertation upon which this book was based. Soon out of print, it seems that no monograph has since been published on the subject, despite the relatively frequent occurrence of the &#x2018;The Horse-Headed One&#x2019; both in Buddhist practice and in religious painting and sculptured images, across Asia.In Hayagriva: Horse Cult in Asia, van Gulik traces the evolution and migration of the god, from its ancient roots in Hindu belief, through its adoption into the Tibetan Buddhist pantheon, and the subsequent migration of its cult westward, through Mongolia and China to Japan. In this long journey, Hayagriva interacted with indigenous, pre-Buddhist horse cults and assumed various attributes as a result, ranging from a deity who conferred fertility, to protector of the faithful from demons, to mythical winged navigator of the vast northern plains.</p><p></p><h2>Kabbalah: An Illustrated Introduction to the Esoteric Heart of Jewish Mysticism</h2><p>The history, meaning and application of the Kabbalah; the mystical teachings based on Hebrew Scriptures.</p><p>Tim Dedopulos is a British writer, game designer, puzzle-setter, and editor. Specializing in the esoteric, he has been studying Kabbalah for over 18 years. He is the author of more than 25 fiction and nonfiction works, including <i>Wizards</i>, <i>The Encyclopedia of Fantasy</i> (with Terry Pratchett and David Pringle), <i>The Brotherhood</i>, and <i>Symbolism</i>. In 2011 he devised <i>The Great Global Treasure Hunt on Google Earth </i>by Carlton, a book and online-based treasure hunt that uses complicated clues in the associated book, online social media, and Google Earth to find a hidden treasure. He lives in central London.<br>There&#x2019;s no doubt that kabbalah, the practice of Jewish mysticism, is not for the faint of heart. As the book&#x2019;s introduction notes, it is nothing less than God&#x2019;s blueprint for creation . . . a vibrant body of mystical techniques and teachings. So it&#x2019;s to Dedopulos&#x2019; credit that he makes (almost) understandable something that is so very complicated. He begins by tracing kabbalah&#x2019;s history and then spends much of the book explaining the basic image of kabbalah, the Tree of Life&#x2014;what it is and what it means. Kabbalah&#x2019;s place in other mystical traditions and in today&#x2019;s world is also covered. The clean format aids concentration, the historical images add interest, and illustrations of the Tree of Life are clear and helpful to learning, but many of the stock photos have little relevance (an image of swans is accompanied by the caption, Swans were thought of as the king of birds . . . as they carried messages and power between rulers). Exercises allow readers to try out meditation techniques that lead closer to the practice of kabbalah. A good starting point. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Home at Last: Song of the West\Unfinished Business</h2><p><p>These two classics by&nbsp;</p><p>#1 New York Times bestselling author&nbsp;</p><p>NORA ROBERTS&nbsp;</p><p>prove that home is where your heart is.&nbsp;</p><p>Song of the West&nbsp;</p><p>Former world-class gymnast Samantha Evans's sole purpose for being in Wyoming is to help her sister through a difficult pregnancy.

It's the adventure she's been looking for and her chance to prove herself a worthy journalist in a field dominated by men.

She lives in Cleveland with her family.Near dawn on July 13, 1936, as three assassins scaled a high garden wall in Tenerife hoping to catch the band of armed guards unaware, I was asleep in a tiny room in Stuttgart, waiting for my life to begin.<br> &nbsp;<br> The killers were professionals. They moved without sound, slinking up hidden ropes, never looking at one another or thinking of anything but the next moment&#x2019;s action. On cat&#x2019;s feet, they fell from the wall to the ground, passing invisibly through the shadows and creeping softly toward their target.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was like a symphony unfolding. Their plan was to take the guards one by one by slitting their throats. Then they would force the door beyond the veranda and climb the marble steps to the little girl&#x2019;s room. Mar�a del Carmen, she was called, ten years old and sweetly sleeping until a rope would gag her quickly and pillows would crush over her small face. Then to the master bedroom, where they would dispatch the last few guards. Everything would be done without firing a single shot. The general and his beautiful wife wouldn&#x2019;t need to stir even a little in their bed beyond the door, their bodies still as a painting by Vel�zquez, until death came.<br> &nbsp;<br> All of this had been set in motion, but then one of the guards turned suddenly and machine-gun fire cut the night. The assassins scattered, barely escaping with their lives. The general woke at the sound of gunfire, but after hearing from his men what had happened, he only stumbled back to bed. Attempts on his life were not rare and particularly not just then, when he was on the cusp of the thing he&#x2019;d waited for, as a tiger waits, just out of sight.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five days later, the planned uprising in Morocco began. The general broadcast a message urging all military officers to join the insurgence and overthrow the Spanish government. Then he sent his wife and daughter into hiding in France, and was taken through the streets of Tenerife, where already the shooting had begun, to a waiting de Havilland Dragon Rapide. He wore civilian clothes and dark glasses and, by way of further disguise, had shaved off his familiar mustache.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was nothing after all this for the trim little plane to take flight, ferrying its passenger to North Africa, where he would prepare the army that would soon overtake mainland Spain. On the way, he donned his uniform, crisp khaki with a red-and-gold belted sash. And just like that, he became General Francisco Franco, newly escaped from exile. Ready to start a war the whole world would be forced to finish.<br> &nbsp;<br> And what was I doing then, at twenty-seven, when Franco made his play for Spain? Standing in a deepening shadow, as everyone was, whether they realized it or not.<br> &nbsp;<br> German troops had recently marched into the Rhineland, and the Nuremberg Laws were being enforced, banning Jews from marrying or bearing children with &#x201c;pure&#x201d; Reich citizens, restricting them from public schools and certain businesses, and essentially branding them, along with Afro-Germans and Gypsies, enemies of the <i>Volksgemeinschaft</i>, so the Nazis could protect their Aryan blood in a race-based state. It was all so shocking and so absolutely wrong. And yet you could almost pretend it wasn&#x2019;t happening by going on with your life and thinking it had nothing to do with you.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had lived in Paris on and off for years, trying to be a writer and also falling in love a lot, without being terribly successful at either. I was dying to write a character as glittering and sharp as Lady Brett from <i>The Sun Also Rises, </i>but since I couldn&#x2019;t, I would settle for trying to be her. I wore long skirts with knit sweaters and sat in caf�s smoking too much and crinkling my eyes and saying, &#x201c;Hello, darling,&#x201d; to near strangers. I ordered cocktails that were far too strong for me, and laughed at things that were desperate, and threw myself hard at experience, by which I mean married men. But the worst of it was walking home alone afterward under a smeary purple sky feeling not at all like Lady Brett but sad and lonely and thoroughly confused about what to do and who to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Something was missing in my life&#x2014;in me&#x2014;and I thought writing could fill it or fix it, or cure me of myself. It was only a notion I had, but I&#x2019;d been following it faithfully, from St. Louis to New York, New York to Paris, Paris to Cannes, to Capri, and now to Stuttgart, where I meant to do research. I&#x2019;d recently begun a novel about a young French couple that would do bold and important things in the name of political pacifism&#x2014;go on strike with coal miners and endure the metal truncheons of the gendarmes, all in the name of social justice.<br> &nbsp;<br> The story felt brave and serious to me when I was hunched over my notebooks in the Weltkriegsbibliothek, but there was a moment every day when I stepped out of the library and was confronted with the actual world. How na�ve and hopeless the idea of pacifism seemed when the streets were full of brownshirts.<br> &nbsp;<br> One day I was at the cinema when two Reich soldiers came through and dragged a young Jewish woman out of her seat in front of me and into the street by the back of her neck like a dog. The lights came down and the film reel began to spin, but I couldn&#x2019;t be still in my chair and be entertained, not now. Walking back to my pension, I startled several times as I caught my reflection in a shopwindow. I looked Aryan enough, with my blond waves and light blue eyes and strong straight nose. I&#x2019;d inherited my features from my parents, after all, who had easily passed as Protestant in anti-Semitic St. Louis. But there was Jewish blood in my family on both sides.<br> &nbsp;<br> From Stuttgart, I moved on to Munich, where things grew even darker and more ominous. I read about Franco&#x2019;s coup in Nazi newspapers, which recounted everything in a boasting, sneering way. The rapidly falling Republican regime was described as a pack of &#x201c;Red Swine Dogs,&#x201d; while Franco glowed, a prince of the Spanish people. Never mind that the government he and his henchmen were overthrowing was the product of the first democratic election in sixty years. Never mind that innocent people were being butchered so that a few could claim power and total dominion.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time I was back in Paris, Franco had declared martial law and vowed to &#x201c;unite&#x201d; Spain again at any cost, even if it meant slaughtering half the population. Most of Spain&#x2019;s military had joined the Nationalists, while untrained civilians struggled to defend cities and villages. Pamplona, �vila, Saragossa, Teruel, Segovia, and the whole of Navarre fell like dominoes before a month had passed. Anyone who spoke against the coup was a target. In the old Moorish city of Badajoz, the Nationalists marched almost two thousand into the Plaza de Toros&#x2014;militiamen and peasant farmers, women and children&#x2014;and opened fire with machine guns, leaving the bodies where they fell, and then pushing on to Toledo, where they would do the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Worse still were the terrible alliances being formed. Nazi Germany sent state-of-the-art Luftwaffe bomber planes and three thousand troops to Spain in exchange for mineral resources, raw copper and iron ore that would soon help Hitler with his own deadly goals. Submarines were sent and more bombers, hundreds of shiploads of supplies and skilled officers to train Franco&#x2019;s men and sharpen their ability to kill and torture.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mussolini came to Franco&#x2019;s aid as well, &#x201c;loaning&#x201d; him eighty thousand troops and forming the third deadly prong of the Fascist triangle. And just like that, after years of sinister plotting, and almost overnight, Europe was a different place, and a more threatening one. It seemed anything could happen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Stalin in the Soviet Union had his own agenda, but for the moment there was much to be gained by aiding Republican Spain. He waited to be joined by the major democracies in the West with arms to sell, but France&#x2019;s government was bitterly divided, and Britain seemed more concerned with the salacious happenings between King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. In the States, Roosevelt was busy trying to manage the crippling effects of the Depression and also in the throes of his reelection campaign. And after all, there was much for America to debate in regard to Spain&#x2019;s pleas for help. There were troubling rumors of arms being given to anarchists and labor-union militias if they would join the Republic&#x2019;s cause&#x2014;a difficult stance to support when there was already so much fear at home about communism.<br> &nbsp;<br> Roosevelt decided on a blanket arms embargo, vowing to keep America out of foreign wars as long as possible. But for some of us who watched the shadows deepen all through that fall of 1936, there was no such thing as a foreign war. Nationalist forces spread through innocent villages, killing tens of thousands as they went. As they shelled the capital of Madrid, surrounding it on three sides, we felt responsible. The Republic of Spain had tried for democracy only to be slashed down and tortured. Why was it not our concern?<br> &nbsp;<br> Slowly, slowly, and then all at once, thousands of people began to come forward as volunteers. International Brigades were formed out of troops from France and America, Canada, Australia, Mexico. Most of the men weren&#x2019;t trained soldiers. Most, in fact, had never held a gun, and yet they grabbed what weapons they could&#x2014;revolvers their fathers had left them, hunting guns, pistols, gas masks from the hardware store&#x2014;and boarded trains, ships, cargo planes.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a beautiful crusade, and though I wasn&#x2019;t immediately sure how I would find a role for myself, later I thought only this:&nbsp;<br> It may be the luckiest and purest thing of all to see time sharpen to a single point. To feel the world rise up and shake you hard, insisting that you rise, too, somehow. Some way. That you come awake and stretch, painfully. That you change, completely and irrevocably&#x2014;with whatever means are at your disposal&#x2014;into the person you were always meant to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> For me the war in Spain will always shine with the light of hard-won transformation. It was like falling in love. Or looking up into the sky to see a burning arrow, which screamed to be followed. It was that simple and complicated all at once. And if more would be set in motion than I could possibly predict or even imagine, I was still ready to say yes. And if I would soon lose my heart forever, never to retrieve it, lose absolutely everything&#x2014;I was ready for that, too. My life seemed to be demanding it. It was calling me forward. There wasn&#x2019;t any choice to be made, in the end. I would have to go to it, with my eyes wide open, and my hands open, too, willing to pay the price.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Who Will You Meet in Scary Street?: Nine Pop-Up Nightmares</h2><p>Invites a visitor to Scary Street to meet its residents, including a witch schoolteacher, Dr. Frank N. Stein the veterinarian, the werewolf who delivers the mail, and the owner and chef of the Count&#39;s Caf�e.</p><p>Ages 3-5. The text is clever, and the paperwork is great in this Halloween pop-up. The premise is that if you walk down Scary Street you'll meet some awful looking creatures. And sure enough, there are a mummy and her baby, both bandage-wrapped, a mail-delivering werewolf who works at the "ghost office," and the local vet, Dr. Frank N. Stein. The pop-ups really zing: a witch unfolds out of a two-page spread as a frog jumps out of her book. In the last sly spread, one monster lifts off her head to reveal a cute girl inside. A sure shot of fun for Halloween story hours. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Like the work of Truman Capote and Tennessee Williams, his stories have been overshadowed by the author&#39;s triumphs writing in other genres. Still, Vidal&#39;s short fiction offers us a portrait of the young artist in the 1940s and 1950s. His subtle and comic tales often center on adolescence and homosexual themes. In Three Stratagems, a middle-aged gay man encounters a male prostitute while vacationing in Key West. In The Zenner Trophy, the star athlete at an elite boys school is expelled for sexual relations with a classmate. These stories were gathered along with five others into a 1956 volume, A Thirsty Evil, and for decades were thought to comprise Vidal&#39;s complete short fiction.</p><p>Gore Vidal is the author of twenty-two novels, five screenplays, more than two hundred essays, and a memoir. Winner of the National Book Award for United Sates: essays 1952-92, Vidal lives in Los Angeles.The rediscovery of the previously unpublished title work is the occasion for collecting Vidal's short stories&#x2014;all eight of them&#x2014;for the first time. That piece, which closes the collection, features an episode from Tennessee Williams's childhood in which the young playwright decides to pre-empt sin through suicide, a decision complicated by knowledge that his uncle is being blackmailed for sexual misconduct with a minor. Discretion kept this story from Vidal's 1956 collection <i>A Thirsty Evil</i>, but it's clearly continuous with the seven others, many of which also contain homoerotic elements and a tone of tart disillusion: in "Three Stratagems," a suave young man suffers an epileptic seizure before he can sell his body; in "The Zenner Trophy," a prep school athlete is expelled for an affair with a male classmate. Mortality and shades of E.B. White's famous distortions of time enter as well, as a middle-aged man runs into himself as a boy ("A Moment of Green Laurel"), and another spends a night in his childhood bedroom ("The Ladies in the Library"). Vidal's short-form execution is strangely ineffective: he often locates action off the page, then labors to bring the information into the story cleanly. But readers will recognize the frosty vision and frequently artful prose of the essayist of <i>United States</i> and the novelist of <i>Myra Breckinridge</i>. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The images in this book, all taken by Maude Schuyler Clay between 1993 and 1998, are the result of the first such undertaking.</p><p> <i>&#x201c;Delta Land</i>,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;is a photographic project which involves the recording and preservation of the Mississippi Delta landscape and its rapidly disappearing indigenous structures: mule barns, field churches, cotton gins, commissaries, crossroads stores, tenant houses, cypress sheds, and railroad stations.</p><p> &#x201c;Moving back in 1987 to the Delta (Tallahatchie County), where I am the fifth generation to live here, allowed me to view the endemic and ordinary landscape as a disappearing way of life. With this work, begun in 1993, I feel I have completed an artistic and educational body of photographs that show the landscape and culture of this particular place; that I have preserved through photography the communities of both whites and African Americans of the Delta region.&#x201d;</p><p> In an introductory essay that populates Clay's almost people-less settings, Lewis Nordan tells how these photographs evoke his Delta boyhood. Like her images, his memories are in black-and-white, &#x201c;the color of grief and all its metaphors.&#x201d; As he recalls the scrappy farms and flaking towns swallowed by the vast flatlands, he writes of his mother's maverick dog and its need of a country home. In Clay's terrains, Nordan sees the Delta land that is at once memorable, familiar, and astonishing.</p></p><p><p>In its stark, black-and-white beauty, a haunting portrait of the vast Mississippi Delta landscape</p><b>Maude Schuyler Clay</b> was born in Greenwood and assisted photographer William Eggleston.

Art Lee&#x2019;s Tying and Fishing the Riffling Hitch will help you learn the language of the hitch, master a unique and enthralling skill and adopt a kind of holistic approach to one of the most sophisticated refinements in all of sport. Once learned you will never go back.&#x201d; </p><p>Orri Vigfusson Chairman of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund and world-renowned angler conservationist </p><p>&#x201d;Art Lee is a great fisherman and a great writer.

She lives in Oregon.</p><p>Catherine was working in the vegetable garden with the other novices on the morning Sister Ursula&#x2019;s family came to take her away. They could hear her pleading and crying all the way across the cloister.<br>&#x201c;What could she have done?&#x201d; Sister Emilie whispered as they continued hoeing the cabbages.<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t imagine,&#x201c; Catherine answered. &#x201c;She always seemed so devout.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sh!&#x201d; Sister Adeline warned. &#x201c;Sister Bertrada is coming this way.&#x201d;<br>The novice mistress stepped carefully between the rows until she came to Catherine.<br>&#x201c;The Abbess H�lo�se wants you,&#x201c; was all she would tell the girl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve no doubt to punish you as you deserve.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No doubt,&#x201c; said Catherine. &#x201c;But for what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;More than impudence this time, girl,&#x201c; Sister Bertrada said grimly. &#x201c;Go at once! The rest of you, get back to your work!&#x201d;<br>She stalked away.<br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d; Emilie nudged Catherine. &#x201c;Try to find out what&#x2019;s happened to Ursula.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I only hope it&#x2019;s not about to happen to me.&#x201d; Catherine put down the hoe and squared her shoulders to face her fate.<br>The prioress answered her timid knock instantly. Without speaking, she led Catherine into H�lo�se&#x2019;s room and, with a reproachful glance, left, shutting the door behind her. Catherine stood motionless in the center of the room, eyes down, waiting for the abbess&#x2019;s reprimand.<br>H�lo�se rose and gently lifted Catherine&#x2019;s chin so that the girl was made to look at her.<br>H�lo�se, abbess of the convent of the Paraclete, was a tiny woman, with huge dark eyes. Twenty years of sorrow and self-control had not clouded them. She had long ago learned to compress the sensuality from her lips, to keep her expression calm, but those eyes would always betray her.<br>She smiled a brief reassurance, then stepped away. Turning to a table by the narrow bed, she picked up a roll of parchment. She seemed more nervous than Catherine as she opened the roll, glanced at it, then twisted it, crumbling the seal as she retied it.<br>Finally, she spoke.<br>&#x201c;Child,&#x201c; she said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re covered with mud.&#x201d;<br>Catherine blushed. &#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201c; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my afternoon to hoe the cabbages.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Does one need to lie flat to do that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201c; Catherine admitted. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see the strings set out to mark the rows of new planting and tripped over one. Then, as I was getting up, I slipped on the mulch and...&#x201d;<br>H�lo�se shook her head in awe. &#x201c;Never mind what else. I suppose you are aware that one of our sisters has been taken from us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Her family arrived quite suddenly this morning. They brought me some information which, they said, made them doubt my suitability to oversee the spiritual welfare of their daughter.&#x201d;<br>Her fine-boned fingers crushed the rolled paper.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201c; Catherine said. But she wasn&#x2019;t sure for what.<br>She waited for the abbess to begin again. H�lo�se seemed in no hurry. She put the roll back on the desk and gazed for a moment out the window toward the river Ardusson. The afternoon light illuminated her face and Catherine thought how beautiful H�lo�se was still, even after so many years in the convent. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to imagine how she must have looked when Peter Abelard had first seen and fallen in love with her. But that was long ago, and H�lo�se had behaved with exemplary rectitude ever since. What could they be saying about her now? Catherine nervously brushed the mud from her skirts. H�lo�se raised her eyebrows as the clods fell on the newly swept floor. Catherine blushed.<br>&#x201c;I would have gone to the dormitory and changed,&#x201c; she explained. &#x201c;But Sister Bertrada said it was urgent. Whatever I did this time, Mother, I truly regret it. I&#x2019;ll take any penance you set.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My dear Catherine.&#x201d; H�lo�se turned away from the window and embraced her, despite the grime on her face and clothes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a penance I am giving you, but a mission.&#x201d;<br>She studied Catherine&#x2019;s face. Catherine returned the look steadily, hoping that, whatever the task, she would be worthy of the need in those eyes. H�lo�se reached up and gently pushed an errant curl back under the novice&#x2019;s wimple. The gentleness of the touch caused Catherine to fight back tears.<br>&#x201c;I will do anything you ask, Reverend Mother,&#x201c; she promised. &#x201c;In my whole life, the only place I have found love and acceptance is here, at the Paraclete. Just tell me what I must do.&#x201d;<br>H�lo�se sighed sharply and turned away. She fumbled with her rosary a moment before <br>&#x201c;I want you to leave here, Catherine, and return home in disgrace.&#x201d; She held up her hand to stop Catherine&#x2019;s cry. &#x201c;And, moreover, I want you to appear bitter and angry toward me and to be prepared to lie to your family and to officers of the Church. You will have to keep your own counsel and trust no one. There may even be some physical risk involved. Although I pray that won&#x2019;t be necessary,&#x201c; she added quickly.<br>Catherine felt the room lurch beneath her. This couldn&#x2019;t be. She swayed dizzily. With a startled exclamation, H�lo�se grabbed her arm and guided her to a wooden stool. Catherine sat and wobbled. The legs were uneven. After a moment, she pulled herself up.<br>&#x201c;Is this a punishment, Mother,&#x201c; she asked, &#x201c;or a test?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Catherine, neither,&#x201c; H�lo�se answered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not doing this well. I felt you should understand the gravity of the matter before I explained in detail.&#x201d;<br>She unrolled the crumpled parchment again and handed it to her. Catherine read the letter with increasing confusion and anger.<br>&#x201c;But this is impossible!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;How could anyone accuse you of such a thing? I helped copy and bind that psalter. We put nothing heretical in it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I know,&#x201c; H�lo�se answered. &#x201c;But the man who wrote Ursula&#x2019;s father says he saw it himself. He swears that not only did several of the commentaries &#x2018;reek of dualism and denial of the sacraments&#x2019; but that they &#x2018;clearly show the perversive influence of Abelard.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br>She paused. Catherine finished reading.<br>&#x201c;These are lies, Reverend Mother!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We used only orthodox sources. Part of the book was compiled from the Cistercian psalters sent to us from Clairvaux as well as the one Master Abelard sent. Who could possibly misinterpret them so grossly?&#x201d;<br>H�lo�se sat again, on her hard and narrow bed. She leaned forward, eyes closed. In her three years at the Paraclete, Catherine had never seen the abbess so vulnerable. She came and knelt by the bed, her head resting on the older woman&#x2019;s skirts. H�lo�se continued, speaking from some point in weary memory.<br>&#x201c;Adam Suger drove me and my nuns from Argenteuil with accusations not half as fearful as these. I sent him the psalter as a symbol of my forgiveness and respect. I hoped we had made our peace. But it would not take much, I fear, to create another coolness. Do you know, child, what Abelard did when he was given refuge at Saint-Denis?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Mother.&#x201d; Catherine smiled in spite of herself. &#x201c;He decided to research the founding of the abbey and discovered that they had been worshiping the wrong Saint Denis.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;And he was fool enough to tell them.&#x201d; H�lo�se smiled too, then sighed. &#x201c;To them it was an intellectual discovery. To them it was a matter of honor. He never understood why they were so furious.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But that was before Suger became abbot. Surely he doesn&#x2019;t still resent Master Abelard.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, probably not, but Suger has no cause to defend him, either. There have been rumors lately that William of Saint-Thierry has been writing letters bringing up the old accusations against Abelard. That he analyzes things man was not meant to understand. That he denies the power of Our Lord and says the Holy Spirit was created by Plato.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter. It&#x2019;s all words. Abelard has made many enemies in his life. William is one of them. They will never let him be. But of all the things Abelard has made, the Paraclete is the one he has given into my care. It is our refuge, and his. I will not let us be used to defeat him and I will not allow his enemies to drive us from here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, Mother! Surely that won&#x2019;t happen!&#x201d;<br>H�lo�se drew herself up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Catherine,&#x201c; she said firmly. &#x201c;And that is why I am forced to ask so much of you. I need someone who knows what the psalter looks like, who will recognize any changes in it. You are the most brilliant scholar here...you know it. You love your books more than your Maker. That&#x2019;s why you haven&#x2019;t made your final vows, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How did you...&#x201d; Catherine was too stunned to dissemble.<br>&#x201c;Furthermore,&#x201c; H�lo�se continued, &#x201c;your family has connections with Saint-Denis. And, since you have not yet officially renounced the world, it is not quite as much a sin for me to send you back into it.&#x201d;<br>By now, Catherine was becoming excited. Of course, her true vocation lay in the convent. Her doubts were minor ones. Where else could she be free to study? But her adjustment to the discipline of the order had been hard. Her conscience reminded her of that every day, even when Sister Bertrada didn&#x2019;t. To be able to serve the Paraclete and H�lo�se and, at the same time, to taste the freedom of life in the World again. She could almost smell the attar of roses on her mother&#x2019;s dressing table. ...</p></p><h2>A Great Adventure in East Africa: An RFC Observer&#39;s WW1 Exploits</h2><p>In 1915, young Leo Walmsley left the Royal Army Medical Corps to become an observer with the newly-formed RFC, soon to become the Royal Air Force.From an early age he was influenced by the many facets of his surroundings, observant of even thesmallest details&#x2014;an ability that was to serve him well.For the young people who joined the armed services during the First World War, it was to be a &#x201c;great adventure&#x201d;, but it is doubtful that when they signed on they could have envisaged what was to befall them.East Africa was considered a &#x201c;side show&#x201d; by many in the military who were mainly concerned about the war in Europe, but for those brave souls who were there the war was all too real. Walmsley survived, despite the dangers, but many of his compatriots did not.This book is about his personal wartime experiences during the that time, a little-documented area of the war, using extracts from his own writings and augmented with recently-acquired prime source material.</p><p></p><h2>The Blue Ribbon Cook Book</h2><p>Jennie C.

Benedict, who was once the most famous caterer in Louisville and also operated a celebrated tea room and soda fountain, trained with Fannie Farmer at the Boston Cooking School. Five editions of Benedict's famous cookbook were published, and her aim in sharing her recipes was simple; as she mentions in the preface, "I have tried to give the young housekeeper just what she needs, and for more experienced ones, the best that can be had in the culinary art."<br><br>As a creative entrepreneur, Benedict had a significant influence on the local culture and foodways. Her sweet and savory dishes were the stars of many Derby parties, and yet she placed equal emphasis on simple luncheon and dinner recipes to satisfy the needs of home cooks. While her popular dishes graced genteel tables all over the Bluegrass, Benedict's chicken salad sandwiches, sold from a pushcart, offered Louisville children the first school lunches in the city.<br><br>This new edition of <i>The Blue Ribbon Cook Book</i> will now welcome new generations of readers and cooks&#x2015;those who remember wearing white gloves and eating delicate tea sandwiches at the downtown department store as well as those who want to make satisfying regional classics such as blackberry jam cake like their grandmother used to make.

He went on to dominate the World Cup races that same year. His success made him an overnight celebrity, but his fame was fleeting. He never won another race, and personal tragedy seemed to follow him at every turn. With his post-Olympic life spiraling out of control, Johnson decided to do the unthinkable make a comeback at the age of forty. He had his motto, Ski to Die,&#x201d; tattooed on his right bicep. In a race at Big Mountain, fearless and in the lead with one turn to go, Johnson crashed face-first into the icy mountain at fifty miles per hour. <i>Ski to Die</i> is a story about the cost of chasing dreams. It is about glory and the attempt to recapture it once it is lost.

Karl, author of commanding biographies of Conrad, Faulkner, and Kafka, meticulously brings Eliot to life. He re-creates her world, London society, and intellectual thought, as well as the world of the gifted or fortunate. He shows how Eliot transformed herself, taking new names as her self developed and grew. With his discussion of Eliot's life, Karl portrays what life was was like for a woman during that time and identifies important women's issues.<p> Eliot, torn between her desire to conserve the past and her urge to change the limitations imposed by class and gender, proves to be a fascinating individual beckoning towards our twentieth-century sense of the modern. Karl's is an unforgettable portrait of a writer whose profound works are recognized today as literary masterpieces.</p>&#39;This is a weighty and authoritative biography which takes account of the latest available scholarship...It gives more than adequate representation of the moral and intellectual distinction which George Eliot carried with her everywhere--the distinction of her work, of course, but also the distinctiveness of her thwarted, striated, and passionate nature.&#39; --Peter Ackroyd, &#39;London Times&#39;</p><h2>Beechcombings: The Narratives of Trees</h2><p><p>This engaging book is about beech trees, but it is also about numerous other issues, including global warming and the importance of trees in the landscape. Trees are the largest and most significant organisms on our planet.&nbsp;Beech trees reached Britain about 8,000 years ago, and they were workhorses, not ornaments: fuel for Rome's glassworks; firewood for London; oars for the ships of Venice; raw material for furniture, cut and turned by "bodgers" who lived like nomads among the trees in huts made of beechwood shavings.&nbsp;Author Richard Mabey&nbsp;discusses beech trees&nbsp;through autobiography, history, and natural history&nbsp;in Europe as well as Britain. His beeches are full of character&#x2014;"hectic, gale-sculpted, gnomic"&#x2014;and he writes about the bluebells, orchids, fungi, deer, and badgers associated with them, as well as the narratives&nbsp;that have been told&nbsp;about trees and the images&nbsp;we make&nbsp;of them. Many other kinds of tree are featured, and the portraits and celebrations of the beech always point to&nbsp;a larger story.

In a delirium of guilt and grief, he wanders through a forest until he comes across an isolated farm run by Vitoria - an indomitable spinster who is &#39;afraid to live&#39;, and her flighty, obsessive cousin Ermelinda, who is terrified of death. As Martin works on Vitoria&#39;s land he is both haunted and comforted by memories of his wife and son. In the intense heat of the Brazilian summer, drought threatens both the farm and its inhabitants, and these three very different but equally domineering characters provoke each other into a realisation of their individual psychological isolation.</p><p>Clarice Lispector (1920-1977) was one of Brazil&#39;s most acclaimed novelists.

When she turned this understanding of human nature away from the crime genre, writing anonymously as Mary Westmacott to prove that her writing could sell on its merit rather than her fame alone, she created bittersweet novels, love stories with a jagged edge, as compelling and memorable as the best of her work.

This work includes her study of these intense feelings and discussions about other cultural issues related to being a person of color, especially Latino, in white society. Essays about contemporary artists Lorna Simpson, Pepo{�}n Osorio, and Juan Sanchez are featured, as are interviews with Andres Serrano and Guillermo Go{�}mez-Pen{�}a. Serrano's photographs, along with those by Robert Mapplethorpe, ignited the far right's indignation toward NEA grant recipients. With Go{�}mez-Pen{�}a, Fusco co-wrote two scripts that were broadcast on National Public Radio. Especially provoking is their collaboration on "The Couple in the Cage," a performance-art piece in which they pretended to be Amerindians from an undiscovered island. Exhibited in a cage and dressed in primitive garb, the couple appeared in several museums. They kept records of the public's reactions on a laptop computer incongruously used during their time in the cage. The essay about their experiences also includes a listing of various "ethnographic exhibitions of human beings," from Christopher Columbus to 20th-century circus displays. <i>Jennifer Henderson</i></p><h2>The Floating Brothel : The Extraordinary True Story of an 18Th-Century Ship and Its Cargo of Female Convicts</h2><p>In July 1789, 237 women convicts left England for Botany Bay in Australia on board a ship called The Lady Julian, destined to provide sexual services and a breeding bank for the men already there. This is the enthralling story of the women and their voyage. Based on painstaking research into contemporary sources such as letters, trial records and the first-hand account of the voyage written by the ship&#39;s steward, John Nicol, this is a riveting work of recovered history. The Floating Brothel brilliantly conjures up the sights, sounds and particularly the smells of life on board ship at the time and is populated by a cast of larger-than-life characters you will never forget.</p><p>Sian Rees was born in Cornwall to a family of sailors and boatbuilders. She studied history at university and first became interested in the transportation of female convicts to Australia when she was living there. This is her first book.In July 1789, the Lady Julian set sail from England, bound for the penal colony at Sydney Bay, New South Wales, and bearing some 240 women sentenced, mostly for petty crimes, to "transportation to parts beyond the seas." The intention of this voyage was twofold: to relieve overcrowding in British jails and t0 provide sexual comfort and eventually children to the male prisoners, from whom nothing had been heard in more than a year. One year later, the ship arrived, its cargo augmented by a number of infants born along the route to the "wives" of her officers and crew. But when it finally dropped anchor, the Lady Julian proved something of a disappointment to the half-starved colonists, who had been hoping more for food than for recreation. The colony was eventually resupplied with food, and these women, salvaged from jails and saved from the gallows, survived and occasionally prospered. Rees descends from a Cornish shipbuilding family and, in her first book, marvelously evokes the sounds and sights of a ship under sail. She is just as good ashore, where her meticulous scholarship vividly re-creates the social conditions of late-18th-century England that produced both the criminal activities of her subjects and the terms of their punishment. Despite the title, relatively little space is given to sexual hi-jinks on the high seas. Instead, Rees uses every scrap of information she can muster to produce a lively, vibrant sense of these women as they must have lived their lives. 17 illus.

The battle on Sunday 18th June 1815, near Waterloo, Belgium was to be Napoleon&#39;s greatest triumph - but it ended in one of the greatest military upsets of all time. Waterloo became a legend overnight and remains one of the most argued-over battles in history. Lord Wellington immortally dubbed it &#39;the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life,&#39; but the British victory became iconic, a triumph of endurance that ensured a 19th century world in which Britain played the key role; it was also a defining moment for the French, bringing Napoleon I&#39;s reign to an end and closing the second Hundred Years&#39; War. Alongside the great drama and powerful characters, Jeremy Black gives readers a fascinating look at where this battle belongs in the larger story of the tectonic power shifts in Europe, and the story of military modernisation. The result is a revelatory view of Waterloo&#39;s place in the broader historical arc.</p><p>Jeremy Black is professor of History at the University of Exeter and is one of the world&#39;s leading military historians.

With inspirational wisdom and engaging clarity, Wilson shows us that the purpose of religion, of our personal relationship with the sacred and the all-pervading mystery of existence, is to expand our consciousness and intensify our sense of life. Wilson heroically claims that the power to create meaning resides in our mental and spiritual discipline. Examining the lives and works of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Rilke, Shaw, Pascal, Swedenborg, Rimbaud and Scott Fitzgerald, among others, Wilson explores the main existential questions and shows how these remarkable writers, scientists, philosophers and poets faced their need for transcendence. Like many of us, they were driven by a need to become more than men. Religion and the Rebel is an outstanding and enjoyable book that combines philosophical analysis, historical interest, and religious insight.</p><p>Colin Wilson, novelist, critic, historian and philosopher, was born in Leicester in 1931. His novels and non-fiction books share a common interest in consciousness and the meaning and purpose of existence. His philosophy, which he called &#x201c;New Existentialism,&#x201d; is built on an optimistic approach to &#x201c;Old Existentialism.&#x201d; His first book, The Outsider, was internationally acclaimed and became an instant bestseller.

I was born part precious metal, part pirate. <br><br>Orphaned and anchorless, Silver is taken in by blind Mr. Pew, the mysterious and miraculously old keeper of the Cape Wrath lighthouse. Pew tells Silver ancient tales of longing and rootlessness, of journeys that move through place and time, of passion and betrayal. His stories center on Babel Dark, a local nineteenth-century clergyman who lived two lives: a public one mired in darkness and a private one bathed in a beacon of light. Pew's stories are, for Silver, a map through her own particular darkness, into her own story and, finally, into love. <br>With Lighthousekeeping, Winterson begins a new cycle and a return to the lyrical intimacy of her earliest work. One of the most original and extraordinary writers of her generation, Winterson has created a modern fable about the transformative power of storytelling. <br></p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0151011176 <br>"An inspired meditation on myth and language." --<i>The New Yorker<br></i><br><i>Lighthousekeeping</i> tells the tale of Silver ("My mother called me Silver.

He is also remembered for his tragic death, at age thirty-two, when the private plane he was piloting crashed in Canton, Ohio, on August 2, 1979.<br><br><i>Munson</i> is the intimate biography of a complex and larger-than-life legend. Written by former Yankees public relations director Marty Appel, who worked closely with Thurman throughout his career, <i>Munson</i> captures the little-known details of the young man from Canton and his meteoric rise to stardom in baseball&#x2019;s most storied franchise. Appel examines the tumultuous childhood that led Thurman to work feverishly to escape Canton&#x2014;and also the marriage and cultural roots that continually drew him back.<br><br>Appel also opens a fascinating door on the famed Yankees of the 1970s, recounting moments and stories that have never been told before. From the clubhouse and the dugout to the front office and the owner&#x2019;s box, this thoughtful baseball biography delves into the affectionately gruff captain&#x2019;s relationships with friends, fans, and teammates such as Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Graig Nettles, and Reggie Jackson, as well as his colorful dealings with manager Billy Martin and his surprisingly close bond with owner George Steinbrenner. <i>Munson</i> paints a revealing portrait of a private Yankee superstar, as well as a nostalgic and revelatory look at the culture&#x2014;and amazing highs and lows&#x2014;of the 1970s New York Yankees teams. More than a biography, <i>Munson</i> is the definitive account of a champion who has not been forgotten and of the era he helped define&#x2014;written with the intimate detail available only to a true insider.<br><br>www.doubleday.com</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, July 2009</strong>: For Yankee fans, catcher Thurman Munson remains a sentimental standout among the storied lineup of George Steinbrenner&#x2019;s late '70s Bronx Zoo dynasty of Yankee baseball, when the team made it to three consecutive World Series, winning in '77 and '78. Former Yankee Public Relations Director Marty Appel was the ghostwriter on Munson's autobiography, and now, three decades later, returns to his legendary subject in the biography, <em>Munson: The Life and Death of a Yankee Captain</em>. <p>As a Yankee insider, Appel keeps Munson, "the heart and soul of a world championship team," in a mostly positive light, though he does reveal more sensational elements of Munson's troubled childhood in Canton, Ohio, where his emotionally abusive father criticized him right up to the end of his short life, even chewing out the casket at Munson's funeral. Appel documents Munson's career as a scholarship athlete at Kent State, his time in the Cape Cod league, and his quick ascension to the major leagues and the Yankees, where he won Rookie of the Year in 1970 and was eventually made team captain, the first player to hold the title since Lou Gehrig. His blue-collar work ethic and gruff but lovable demeanor made him an instant fan favorite (a shot of him making a tag at home plate was the first action photo used in a Topps baseball card). And during that Bronx Zoo era, gloriously depicted in <em>Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning</em>, it was the down-to-earth Munson who balanced out (and butted heads with) his flashy teammate Reggie Jackson. After Jackson made his infamous "I'm the straw that stirs the drink" comments in a <em>Sport</em> magazine interview, Munson was asked if Jackson was quoted out of context. Munson's reply: "For three pages?"</p> <p>Munson was only 32 when he was killed after the plane he was piloting crashed in Canton, Ohio, on August 2, 1979. Despite so many bitter memories of Ohio, it's where he ended up marrying and starting a family, and part of the reason he learned how to fly was to be able to increase visits to his family from New York. Even though he was a relatively inexperienced pilot, he quickly worked his way up from a two-piston engine to a jet. And pilot error was eventually cited as the reason for the crash, which occurred while practicing touch-and-go-landings. At the home-opener the day after his death, when No. 15 was retired, there was a ten-minute standing ovation in memory of the Yankee catcher. Munson was never inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, but Marty Appel's biography remains a fitting tribute. <em>--Brad Thomas Parsons</em></p> <p></p> <br><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Marty Appel on Why Munson Matters</strong><br><br> Sports biographies can get a little nasty these days. Have a quick look at the covers of new books this year--a year in which I&#x2019;m thrilled to see the publication of <em>Munson</em>, my new biography of Thurman Munson, by the way--and you see the story. On the one hand, you see a classic shot of Thurman, the old-school catcher and Captain of the Bronx Zoo... And on the other, well, you get players linked to steroids.<br> <p>There is the feeling, looking at that photo of Munson, that he represented something genuine and beautiful about baseball, and maybe something bigger--a respect for the profession, a pride in performance. Oh, how he played the game!</p> <p>As Munson&#x2019;s co-author on his autobiography more than 30 years ago, I have marveled at the enduring loyalty of his fans, and at the palpable emotion his image on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard still produces throughout the stands. The autobiography was an honor to write, but in my heart, I always felt there was much more to the story. Now, with the 30th anniversary of Thurman&#x2019;s tragic death, the time was right to tell the whole story. He would have been okay with that, because I think he would be proud of his accomplishments off the field, and proud that they could be used as an example for others.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a wonderful story. And, of course, a tragic one, too. It was Thurman&#x2019;s devotion to his family that got him into aviation, all the better to get home and spend more time with his wife and kids. And ultimately, he just took on too much airplane for his fledgling abilities.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s my hope that <em>Munson</em> gives fans a definitive and intimate look at the man in full. I conducted about 150 interviews with his friends, teammates, and associates to examine his childhood, his illustrious career, and of course, the tragic crash that took his life--and the aftermath that made him a Yankee legend for the ages.</p> <p>I know it&#x2019;s unusual for the same author to revisit a subject 30 years apart, but when offered the opportunity to do this, I jumped at it. For Yankee fans, and all baseball fans, this is a look at the captain of those "Bronx Zoo," "Bronx Is Burning" teams and how he led by example. <em>Munson</em> is a story of redemption, of how one man turned his life around and became a role model not only for his gutsy play behind the plate, but for his life off the field.</p> <p>Thurman wasn&#x2019;t perfect. He was as flawed as we all are in some ways. But in the end, I think the reader will see him for what he was--a Yankee hero, with a life worth admiring. <em>--Marty Appel</em></p> <p>(Photo � Raquel Lauren)</p> <br> <br><p>Following his years as the Yankees&#x2019; PR director, Marty Appel became an Emmy Award&#x2013;winning television producer and coauthored Munson&#x2019;s bestselling autobiography, as well as a number of other books.

Bell and Rand introduce each material type&#x2014;glass, concrete, wood, metal, plastic, and stone&#x2014;with new text describing its history and significance. Accessible case studies highlight recent advances in design and construction around the world&#x2014;from a wooden church in Finland and huts in Thailand to a bank encased in a glass cube in Denmark. In a materials landscape that constantly changes to meet the demands of contemporary designers, <em>Materials for Design 2</em> is an up-to-date guide to the best and most exciting materials at their disposal.</p><p>Victoria Ballard Bell is an architect who lives and works in Raleigh, NC.<br><br>Patrick Rand is a professor in the School of Architecture at North Carolina State University College of Design.&#34;The breadth of projects is amazing, and the clarity with which they are presented is perfect.

The Art Deco style is so recognizable and widespread that its original influence on the culture in which it emerged has been all but lost in the clutter of imitation. This book draws our attention back to the birth of Art Deco&#x2015;a period between two devastating world wars when industrialization was flourishing, interest in archaeology was peaking, and movements such as Cubism, Constructivism, Futurism, and Modernism were turning the art world on its head. Brilliantly designed to reflect the style it celebrates, Art Deco is filled with hundreds of examples of painting, architecture, interiors, jewelry, crafts, furniture, and fashion. Author Norbert Wolf traces the chronology of the Art Deco style by looking at the politics and culture of Europe in the 1920s and early 1930s, and the artistic movements that paralleled its popularity. He follows Art Deco&#x2019;s influence in Europe and its immigration to the Americas and Asia. Most importantly, this wide-ranging volume looks beyond the era of Art Deco&#x2019;s origination to the present day. Pointing to the numerous revivals and contemporary echoes in painting and even literature, this beautiful volume demonstrates that Art Deco is alive and well today&#x2015;often in forms where we least expect it.</p><p>NORBERT WOLF&#39;s many books on art include Albrecht Durer, Art Nouveau, and The Art of the Salon (all by Prestel).

But the rhetoric about nuclear weapons and jihad obscures the real Iran: an ancient nation and culture, both sophisticated and isolated, which still exists clandestinely in major cities as well as the country's remote mountains and deserts. <br><br>Jason Elliot has spent the last four years traveling in Iran, and in this remarkable book he reveals the many sides of the culture, art, architecture, and people that Westerners cannot see or conveniently ignore. Part close reading of symbols and images, part history, and part intimate interviews with Iranians of many different kinds--from wealthy aristocrats at forbidden parties to tribal horsemen in the most remote mountain villages, who have never seen a Westerner--<i>Mirrors of the Unseen</i> is a beautiful and thought-provoking book by one of the world's most acclaimed adventurers and authors.</p><p>Jason Elliot lives in London. This is his&nbsp;second book.<i>Starred Review.</i> Elliot (<i>An Unexpected Light</i>) traveled to Iran and returned with this finely detailed, timely portrait of a country and culture precariously balanced between East and West, dark and light, integration and Armageddon. Whether careening around the smog and traffic clogged capital city of Tehran in a battered cab or crawling through the rubble-strewn ruins of Persepolis, capital of the ancient Persian kings, Elliot's keen eye, supple mind and compelling way with words captures the rich, complex, contradictory essence of Iran, its history and people. Everywhere he travels, Elliot explores a central question&#x2014;will Iran, a country with a deep and abiding history of scientific innovation, fine art, high culture and beauty, step into modernity or will the revolutionary mullahs, the guardians and promoters of Islamic fundamentalism, take the country further down the road of isolation. In the cities, a culture of duality exists&#x2014;behind closed doors, liquor flows freely, music is enjoyed and women are free to express themselves fully. On the streets, however, religious extremism rules, manifested by squads of bearded enforcers looking out for infractions of their version of Islamic law. With Iran so central in the news, this is a good read for the armchair traveler and amateur geo-political strategist alike. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Character development must be sacrificed to pacing and plotting, or forensic detail must be displaced by rapid-fire action sequences. But Sergeant Joe Dartelli is a captivating personality enmeshed in a balanced, suspenseful, and intelligently scripted serial murder mystery. <p> What makes this mystery so different is that many of its secrets are held within Dartelli's mind. From the opening pages, Joe is haunted by a supposed suicide case, the mysterious "Ice Man," who he suspects could be linked to his old mentor. Afraid of the truth, Joe struggles to explain away a new suicide while we watch the facts unfold within him. As an added treat, Ridley Pearson displays remarkable computer savvy as Dartelli's old flame, Ginny, hacks her way through to some of the most crucial parts of the puzzle. The author is not afraid to linger on small details--a woman's earrings or the temperature of a corpse--but he rarely overindulges in such description. Rather, he has written an excellent piece of fiction that happens to be a police thriller.

He lives in Los Angeles</p>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>John Lennon raced into Yoko Ono's home office in the mammoth old Dakota building with a copy of Donna Summer's new single, "The Wanderer." "Listen!" he shouted as he put the 45 on the record player. "She's doing Elvis!" I didn't know what he was talking about at first. The arrangement felt more like rock than the singer's usual electro-disco approach, but the opening vocal sure sounded like Donna Summer to me. Midway through the song, however, her voice shifted into the playful, hiccuping style Elvis had used on so many of his early recordings.<br><br>"See! See!" John said, pointing at the speakers.<br><br>The record was John's way of saying hello again after five years. I had spent time with him in Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, during the period he later referred to as his "lost weekend"--months when he was estranged from Yoko and spent many a night in notorious drinking bouts with his buddies Harry Nilsson and Ringo Starr. John got so boisterous one night that he was thrown out of the Troubadour, one of the city's landmark music clubs. He invited me to dinner a few times, and I later found out it was when he had an important business meeting the next morning and didn't want to wake up with a hangover. I got the nod over Harry and Ringo because I didn't drink anything stronger than Diet Coke. We would eat at a chic Chinese restaurant and then return to his suite at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Those hours would race by because we loved talking about our favorite rock hero, Elvis, which brings us back to "The Wanderer."<br><br>I've experienced hundreds of memorable concert and interview moments, so it's hard to rank them in any favorite order, but my final hours with John in New York are certainly on the short list. It was just weeks before his death in December of 1980, and his playing the Summer record was an endearing greeting--and one that was typical of John. Of the hundreds of musicians I've met, John was among the most down-to-earth.<br><br>I was in New York to spend three days with John and Yoko while they finished Double Fantasy, John's first collection of new material since the mostly forgettable Walls and Bridges six years earlier. He returned to New York after the "lost weekend" period and spent the next five years rebuilding his life with Yoko and helping to raise their son, Sean. On this day, he looked nice and trim in jeans, a jean jacket, and a white T-shirt. He was maybe twenty-five �ds slimmer than the last time I'd seen him. "It's Mother's macrobiotic diet," he said later, and employing his nickname for Yoko. "She makes sure I stay on it."<br><br>By the time we headed to the recording studio, it was nearly dark. As the limo pulled up to the studio's dimly lit entrance, I could see the outlines of a couple dozen fans in the shadows. They raced toward the car as soon as the driver opened John's door. Flashbulbs went off with blinding speed. Without a bodyguard, John was helpless, and I later asked if he didn't worry about his safety. "They don't mean any harm," he replied. "Besides, what can you do? You can't spend all your life hiding from people. You've got to get out and live some, don't you?"<br><br>Inside the studio, I heard several tracks from Double Fantasy, which was John's most revealing album since Imagine. Some critics branded the gentle, relaxed tone of the collection too soft. They missed the old Lennon bite. To me, however, the collection was a marvelous reflection of John's mood, and Grammy voters were right when they named it album of the year.<br><br>I spent hours at the apartment and the studio talking to John about the changes since Los Angeles. He felt at peace for one of the few times in his life. He was deeply in love with Yoko and thrilled to be a father again. He also spoke with affection about the Beatles days and how much he still looked forward to seeing Paul. That surprised me because of the sarcastic barbs he'd launched in interviews and the biting lyrics he'd written about Paul since the breakup of the band. "Aw, don't believe all that," he said, smiling. "Paul is like a brother. We've gotten way past all that." He also spoke fondly of Ringo, but more distantly about George. He felt slighted by some things in George's autobiography, I, Me, Mine, especially George's failure to give John credit for helping him learn guitar techniques.<br><br>Mostly, we talked about the "house husband" period that was just ending, a time of emotional drying out, a chance to reset priorities. He may have declared "I don't believe in Beatles" in "God" on his 1970 album, Plastic Ono Band, but it took the five-year sabbatical that followed the "lost weekend" for him to break away from the suffocating pressures of being an ex-Beatle, including the need to mirror in his music and in his life the image of the witty, sarcastic John. During his time away, he learned that there was personal joy and fulfillment away from the rock 'n' roll merry-go- round. For Double Fantasy, he even wrote a tender song about his newfound outlook and freedom, "Watching the Wheels."<br><br>On that November night, the studio atmosphere was so relaxed that John invited me to contribute to the album's sound effects. Yoko and I took turns dropping coins in a tin bowl to duplicate the sound of someone giving change to a beggar. We had to do it several times before the noise level was just right. For most of the evening, I just watched John and Yoko at work--and took advantage of breaks to ask them questions. The studio tape must have been running much of the time, because years later a bootleg of that interview surfaced in Japan.<br><br>One thing troubled me during the all-night recording sessions: the way John would slip from time to time into an adjoining lounge. The first thing that came to mind was drugs, because I was so used to seeing musicians pass around bowls of cocaine with the casualness of M&amp;Ms. John had had drug problems earlier in his life, and I feared he had relapsed--despite all his talk about feeling healthier than ever. Maybe the pressure of being back in the studio was greater than he was letting on. At one point, I happened into the lounge and saw John at the far end of the narrow room. He was reaching for something on a cabinet shelf, and my first instinct was to go back into the studio so I wouldn't violate his privacy. But he spotted me and called me over, putting his finger up to his lips in a signal to be quiet. When I was next to him, he reached into the cabinet again and pulled out something wrapped in a towel.<br><br>"Want some?" he asked. "Just don't tell Mother," he said with a conspiratorial look. "She doesn't want me doing this anymore."<br><br>As he opened the towel, I had to laugh.<br><br>John Lennon's private stash turned out to be a giant-size Hershey bar. He broke off a chunk for me and one for himself. Holding his piece in a toast, John smiled and said, "Good to see you again."<br><br>Years later, I told the chocolate-bar story to Bono, and he loved it--the idea of a Beatle, someone who had been exposed to every possible temptation, delighting in something as simple as a candy bar. It was a little after midnight and Bono and I were the last customers in a restaurant in the Clarence Hotel in Dublin. Much had changed since early in the band's career, when I had sat with Bono on the steps of the same grand old hotel as he told me about his dreams for U2. Now, he and the Edge, his bandmate, owned the Clarence. I'd been interviewing him for a couple of hours about U2's latest album, but now the tape recorder was off and Bono was asking the questions. He liked hearing stories about some of his favorite rock stars, especially John, Elvis, and Bob Dylan.<br><br>I've known Bono ever since U2 first came to America in the early 1980s, and I always looked forward to these postinterview chats. I was impressed early on by his belief in the power of rock 'n' roll to elevate, which I felt was the music's greatest quality. But I also came to appreciate his hunger for stories about the personal sides of his rock 'n' roll heroes. Originally, I thought it was just the fan in him asking the questions, but as U2 became more successful, I realized that it was reassuring for Bono to hear about the human qualities of his heroes. So many great artists have told me how hard it is to balance all the acclaim and attention against their private doubts, insecurities, and needs.<br><br>Over time, I began to see in Bono many of the qualities of his heroes, especially John. He and Bono would have been great mates. John would have been delighted by Bono's love of Elvis, but, more importantly, by his ability to campaign for his social beliefs. Like John, Bono absolutely believes that social change is possible, not just a utopian dream. While John chiefly believed in singing about it, Bono feels a responsibility to use his fame to take his case directly to world leaders in commerce and politics. In turn, Bono is inspired as a songwriter by observing firsthand the impact that rock 'n' roll has in motivating those world figures. "I see it in everyone I meet, whether it's Bill Clinton or Bill Gates," he told me. "Music ... the music of rock 'n' roll has shaped their social values. This music is a guidepost for the modern world."<br><br>Bono and I kept at it for another two hours--talking about the time I made out a set list for Dylan in Israel; when I visited Leonard Cohen, another of his favorites, at a Zen colony near Los Angeles; and all the times I saw Elvis in Las Vegas. I had told him some of these stories before, but he delighted in listening to them again. Finally, I begged off. I had to be up at 7:00 the next morning to catch a plane for London. On the flight home, I thought about what Bono had said about music changing people's attitudes and values, and I realized how much I, too, had been affected by all the years of listening to this revolutionary sound.<br><br>I've always felt that one of the main challenges for a rock critic is to focus on those musicians who contribute to expanding that art form. In searching for those artists, I frequently ended up writing about false promises: artists who ran out of ideas, self-destructed, or compromised their music in hopes of wider sales. But I was also fortunate enough to connect with the most important artists of the rock era.<br><br>I came to appreciate the tremendous toll that rock can take on an artist's personal life, how there is often far more drama offstage than on. In the end, all it takes to be a star is luck and a commercial sound, which explains why we have so many mediocre hit makers. To be a true artist, you need enormous talent, fierce ambition, an original vision, and an unyielding toughness. I saw some artists triumph because they were tough and others die because they weren't tough enough.<br><br>I've also spoken to thousands of fans about what they want from music. Some are just after entertainment, others respond to unchecked anger and rebellion, still others like a band because their friends do, and there are those who value artists with the insight and craft to uplift and inspire us. No single rock 'n' roll diet works for everyone. We all have different musical DNA, and we all follow different musical paths. Yet there is a unifying quality about rock 'n' roll that helps instill confidence and hope in millions of fans at times in their lives when little else makes sense.<br><br>What linked Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash and Ray Charles, the Beatles and Bob Dylan was the old-fashioned American notion that each individual can make a difference, whether you are a truck driver from Memphis or a blind piano player from southwest Georgia. Rock 'n' roll is the promise of a better day, and the best artists spread that message with an almost missionary zeal. I've always believed in that liberating message, which is probably why I respond most to artists who fight to keep the promise alive.</p><h2>McSweeney&#39;s Issue 51</h2><p><li>Each issue of the quarterly is completely redesigned.

Yet today only four companies make vaccines, and there is a growing crisis in vaccine availability. Why has this happened? This remarkable book recounts for the first time a devastating episode in 1955 at Cutter Laboratories in Berkeley, California, thathas led many pharmaceutical companies to abandon vaccine manufacture.<p></p>Drawing on interviews with public health officials, pharmaceutical company executives, attorneys, Cutter employees, and victims of the vaccine, as well as on previously unavailable archives, Dr. Paul Offit offers a full account of the Cutter disaster. He describes the nation&#x2019;s relief when the polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1955, the production of the vaccine at industrial facilities such as the one operated by Cutter, and the tragedy that occurred when 200,000 people were inadvertently injected with live virulent polio virus: 70,000 became ill, 200 were permanently paralyzed, and 10 died. Dr. Offit also explores how, as a consequence of the tragedy, one jury&#x2019;s verdict set in motion events that eventually suppressed the production of vaccines already licensed and deterred the development of new vaccines that hold the promise of preventing other fatal diseases.<p></p></p><p><p>PAUL OFFIT, M.D., is Chief of Infectious Diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a professor of pediatrics and Maurice R. Hilleman Professor of Vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</p>"What is causing the shortage of desperately needed vaccines to combat pneumonia, tetanus, chicken pox, measles, mumps and influenza? Why is an effective vaccine for Lyme disease no longer on the market? And what are the consequences for our children? Dr. Paul Offit confronts these vital questions in <i>The Cutter Incident</i>, a brilliant piece of writing about a medical tragedy, exactly fifty years ago, that revolutionized the development and testing of vaccines in the United States, while forever changing the legal culture that had once kept punitive lawsuits under control. Offit&#x2019;s remarkable book is certain to become a fixture in the increasingly angry battle over the impact of medical liability on the effective treatment of disease."&#x2014;David M.

Best known for the creation of two fictional worlds based on Blandings Castle and the Wooster-Jeeves, gentleman-valet duo, Wodehouse is appreciated&nbsp;the world over for his exceedingly clever and comically savvy send-ups of the idle rich in Edwardian England.<br><br>In <i>The Code of The Woosters</i>, it takes all the ingenuity of Jeeves, the gentleman's&nbsp; gentleman&nbsp;extraordinaire, to rescue his hapless and hopelessly obtuse young employer, Bertie Wooster, from the pickle of a plot to steal a silver jug from the home of an irascible magistrate.</p><p>A Jeeves and Wooster novel <p>[insert P.G.

But purloining the antique cow creamer from under the baleful nose of Sir Watkyn Bassett is the least of Bertie&#x2019;s tasks. He has to restore true love to both Madeline and Gussie and to the Revd Stinker Pinker and Stiffy Byng &#x2013; and confound the insane ambitions of would-be Dictator Roderick Spode and his Black Shorts. It&#x2019;s a situation that only Jeeves can unravel...</p>P.G.Wodehouse&#39;s best-loved creation by far is the master-servant team of Bertie Wooster, the likable nitwit, and Jeeves, his effortlessly superior valet and protector.

From a bloodthirsty butcher who came after his family (<i>Cat and Mouse</i>) to a devilish duo working cross-country (<i>Kiss the Girls</i>), Cross has managed to outmaneuver all of his enemies. Until he meets the Weasel.<p> A series of killings in the forgotten, crime-infested ghettos of southeast D.C. has sent Cross and his 6'9" 250-pound partner, John Sampson, in search of the "Jane Doe" killer. However, their racist, tyrannical boss George Pitman orders them to stay out of the southeast and investigate the high-profile murder of a wealthy white man. Cross already has suspicions that the murders are linked, but when Sampson's ex turns up in an abandoned southeast warehouse kicked to death, the two detectives carry on with their original investigation. Meanwhile, Cross's longtime love, Christine (<i>Cat and Mouse</i>), has taken prominence in his life, and it looks as if the two will finally get hitched--with one glitch: Cross puts everything he loves in jeopardy as he obsessively goes after the Weasel. </p><p>Akin to a slick Hollywood action flick, <i>Pop Goes the Weasel</i> doesn't have time for meaningful character development or thoughtful moral analysis. And it doesn't need to. Its winning formula is based on short scenes (chapters average about 3 pages), addictive plot progression, and mean dialogue: "Sampson sighed and said, 'I think her tongue is stapled inside the other girl. I'm pretty sure that's it, Alex. The Weasel stapled them together.' I looked at the two girls and shook my head. 'I don't think so. A staple, even a surgical one, would come apart on the tongue's surface.... Crazy glue would work." <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p>Alex Cross is back, to face his most complex and formidable villain yet, a man known as The Weasel, who threatens to destroy all Alex holds dear.<br><br>Things are looking great for Alex Cross. He is in love with a very special woman and even a series of ghastly murders he's investigating can't diminish his happiness. Cross's pursuit of the killer quickly produces a suspect- a British diplomat named Geoffrey Shaffer. However, proving that Shaffer is the murderer is a difficult challenge. The diplomat engages in a brilliant series of surprising counter moves, in court and out, and Cross and his fiancee become the targets of a deadly cabal of killers masterminded by Shaffer.<br><br><i>Pop!Goes the Weasel</i> is James Patterson at the peak of his power. It's his most dynamic and powerful psychological thriller to date. Here is a villain no reader will forget, a love story of great tenderness, and a plot of relentless suspense and heart pounding pace. Booksellers and readers will soon discover why James Patterson is at the very top of his field and one of the finest suspense writers of his time.</p><h2>Contemporary American realism since 1960</h2><p>255 pp. 59 color, 150 black-and-white illustrations.

At that moment, he could not have imagined his own violent and tragic death in the wastelands of Utah&#39;s Great Basin. Yet, in the chill dawn of October 26, 1853, Captain Gunnison and his party were mysteriously and brutally murdered. For one hundred and forty years, the tragedy of the murder of the young army engineer, whom the Mormons referred to as their &#34;much esteemed, though distant, learned, very polite, and unsolicited chronicler,&#34; was left as unexplored as the site of his death near the Sevier River. Now, Dr Fielding reveals and unravels the twisting and long-buried course of events, showing how the murder of the Gunnison survey party led inexorably to the infamous Massacre at Mountain Meadows, to the Utah Expedition, and to a generation of conflict between the Mormons and the United States Government.</p><p></p><h2>Out of Passau: Leaving a City Hitler Called Home</h2><p>Anna Elisabeth Rosmus began her life&#39;s work unexpectedly at age 20 when she wrote an essay about her hometown during the Third Reich for a national contest. She never dreamed her youthful research would be the start of a distinguished publishing career and that her life would be the basis for the 1990 Academy Award-nominated film The Nasty Girl. Passau, Germany, her entire life, yet she was unaware that the father of Heinrich Himmler had once been a professor at the college-preparatory high school she attended or that Adolf Hitler and other prominent Nazi party members had grown up just across the Danube River in Austria. Since Rosmus had no knowledge of these and other Nazi affiliations and activities in her hometown, she embarked on her essay project confident that the Passau citizenry would be proud of her findings. Rosmus had no inkling she had just begun what would become a lifelong effort to uncover Passau&#39;s buried complicity in the crimes of the Nazi state - an effort that would bring overwhelming gratitude from the international Jewish community but contempt and ostracism from the people whom she had known all her life. about her fateful decision to expose her hometown&#39;s Nazi past. In this volume Rosmus recounts her determination after years of persecution, threats and physical attacks to immigrate to the United States. Despite the praise she had earned around the world, officials and citizens of Passau continued to obstruct her work. In this memoir, Rosmus relives her turmoil over whether to stay in Passau or to leave; describes the more open-minded world she found in Washington D.C.; and discusses how she has been able to carry on her research from the United States.</p><p>"It is a paradox of the Holocaust that the innocent feel guilty and the guilty innocent. Nowhere is this more true than in the actions of the young Germans. Anna Rosmus&#x2019;s Against the Stream is a riveting account of one young woman&#x2019;s uncompromising attempt to discover the hidden past of her community and the hidden history of her town. The guilty feel so innocent that they created myths of resistance and heroism to shade their history of complicity and submissiveness. They did not allow unfettered access to archives even for an innocent girl writing a term paper; and beginning as a girl and growing into a bold and brave woman, Rosmus confronted the truth and refused to go along with the comfortable fables that disguised what really happened. Against the Stream is written with passion and honesty and without any self-aggrandizement or attempt to portray oneself as a hero. Rosmus&#x2019;s work is formidable; so too her person. Her work is essential for the future of German! y, for the only way to overcome the past is to do as Rosmus has done&#x2014;face it honestly, openly, and bravely and let the truth set you free." &#x2014;Michael Berenbaum <p>"The real Nasty Girl is an intellectual firebrand, a rigorous researcher burning with a passion to tell the story that must be told.

In the <em>ghazal,</em> each stanza is an independent poem, so the writer is able to shift landscapes. One stanza may be biographical, the next may have a reference to myth, the next a meditation on conscience.</p><p>In these poems, the reader will find many references to our own cultural past, as in Sir Isaac Newton, Gustav Mahler, ZLord Tennyson, Francis Bacon, and Madame Bovary, figures who belong to our intellectual history. The poems bring something startling and new. Merging wildness and a beautiful formality, <em>The Night Abraham Called to the Stars</em> is Robert Bly's greates volume of poetry and ensures his reputation as one of the major poets of our era.</p></p><p><p>Robert Bly's books of poetry include <em>The Night Abraham Called to the Stars</em> and <em>My Sentence Was a Thousand Years of Joy</em>. His awards include the National Book Award for poetry and two Guggenheims. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>When Iron John: A Book About Men took off in the early '90s, Bly's poetic reputation was instantly eclipsed, though he had long embraced mythic precedents and close examination of masculine feelings in his work. Bly has also worked in collaboration with linguists to translate Islamic religious poetry, and this eighth collection reflects these and other varied and sustained interests. The book's 48 lyrics are written in a single (here terceted) form, the ghazal, used by such great Islamic poets as Ghalib, and harness high points of Western art and literature to draw general, biblically backed conclusions about the human condition out of the mire. The three poems inspired by Rembrandt are probably the best here, simple in diction and understated in effect: "Titus receives a scattering of darkness./ He's baptized by water soaking in onions;/ The father protects his son by washing him in the night." But too many lines veer from the prosaic into the clunky in their quest for universal imagery: "My heart is a calm potato by day, and a weeping,/ Abandoned woman by night," notes the speaker of the title poem. After a series of mentions of animals in "The Wildebeest," a reference to "The Moses of the beaver" is unconsciously comic at best. The cultural references follow one another at a fast and furious pace, and while the initial surprise of finding Chekhov and Blake or Kierkegaard and Cezanne in the same poem can be pleasant, there is little holding them there beyond Bly's will-to-form. No one will doubt Bly's sincerity, but the poems fall short of the heady figures they invoke. (May)Forecast: Despite their flaws, these poems surpass the new work of last year's Eating the Honey of Words: New &amp; Selected Poems. Bly's multitude of fans will recognize their hero's concerns and preoccupations, here more elegiacally than ever, and relish some of the real achievements. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Van Gogh&#39;s Ear</h2><p><p>The best-known and most sensational event in Vincent van Gogh&#x2019;s life is also the least understood. For more than a century, biographers and historians seeking definitive facts about what happened on a December night in Arles have unearthed more questions than answers. Why would an artist at the height of his powers commit such a brutal act? Who was the mysterious &#x201c;Rachel&#x201d; to whom he presented his macabre gift? Did he use a razor or a knife? Was it just a segment&#x2015;or did Van Gogh really lop off his entire ear?</p><p> In <i>Van Gogh&#x2019;s Ear</i>, Bernadette Murphy reveals, for the first time, the true story of this long-misunderstood incident, sweeping away decades of myth and giving us a glimpse of a troubled but brilliant artist at his breaking point. Murphy&#x2019;s detective work takes her from Europe to the United States and back, from the holdings of major museums to the moldering contents of forgotten archives. She braids together her own thrilling journey of discovery with a narrative of Van Gogh&#x2019;s life in Arles, the sleepy Proven�al town where he created his finest work, and vividly reconstructs the world in which he moved&#x2015;the madams and prostitutes, caf� patrons and police inspectors, shepherds and bohemian artists. We encounter Van Gogh&#x2019;s brother and benefactor Theo, his guest and fellow painter Paul Gauguin, and many local subjects of Van Gogh&#x2019;s paintings, some of whom Murphy identifies for the first time. Strikingly, Murphy uncovers previously unknown information about &#x201c;Rachel&#x201d;&#x2015;and uses it to propose a bold new hypothesis about what was occurring in Van Gogh&#x2019;s heart and mind as he made a mysterious delivery to her doorstep.</p><p> As it reopens one of art history&#x2019;s most famous cold cases, <i>Van Gogh&#x2019;s Ear</i> becomes a fascinating work of detection. It is also a study of a painter creating his most iconic and revolutionary work, pushing himself ever closer to greatness even as he edged toward madness&#x2015;and one fateful sweep of the blade that would resonate through the ages.</p></p><p>Bernadette Murphy was born and raised in the U.K. She has lived in the south of France for most of her adult life and worked in many different fields. <i>Van Gogh&#x2019;s Ear</i> is her first book."Bernadette Murphy is an indefatigable researcher and compelling storyteller. She casts dramatic new light on one of history's most famous episodes of self-harm, neatly and convincingly skewering many long-held myths and forcing us to reappraise what we know of Van Gogh's life."<b> </b><b>&#x2015;Ross King, author of <i>Brunelleschi's Dome </i>and <i>Leonardo's Last Supper </i></b></p><h2>Richard Hamilton</h2><p><p>Still little-known in the United States, Richard Hamilton is a key figure in twentieth-century art. An original member of the legendary Independent Group in London in the 1950s, Hamilton organized or participated in groundbreaking exhibitions associated with the group--in particular This Is Tomorrow (1956), for which his celebrated collage Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?, crystallizing the postwar world of consumer capitalism, was made. With his colleagues in the Independent Group, Hamilton promoted the artistic investigation of popular culture, undertaking this analysis in paintings, prints, and texts, thus setting the stage for Pop art--indeed, he is often called the intellectual father of Pop. At the same time, Hamilton was crucial to the postwar reception of Marcel Duchamp, transcribing his notes for The Large Glass and producing a reconstruction of this epochal piece for the first Duchamp retrospective in Britain, in 1966. Over the years Hamilton has continued to develop his work, in a variety of media, on subjects ranging from the Rolling Stones to the Troubles in Northern Ireland, from new commodities and technologies to the oldest genres in Western painting. True to the mission of the October Files series, this volume collects the most telling essays on Hamilton (including several hard-to-find texts by the artist), spanning the entire range of his extraordinary career.</p></p><p><p>Hal Foster is Townsend Martin '17 Professor of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University.

He lived in Paris and New York City. Coe&#39;s first novel, I Look Divine, was published in 1987, his second, Such Times, in 1993. His style has been called &#34;reminiscent of both Oscar Wilde&#39;s and Marcel Proust&#39;s late writings&#34; (Publishers Weekly). In 1994, Christopher Coe died of AIDS.Like Dorian Gray, the exquisite Nicholas limned in this sleek and troubling novella may become a cult figure. The self-absorbed, narcissistic young man feels he has been exceptional from the moment of his birth by Caesarian section,; he was thus unmarked and more perfect than other babies. "There is no such thing as more perfect," corrects his mother. "Of course there is," says Nicholas. To avoid unsightly lines, he never smiles when photographed; to avoid even a trace of fat, he eats little: the obi of the kimono in which he often poses winds twice around his waist. The men he fancies bestow upon him rare enamels, ivory carvings, jewelsbecause, he explains with apparent guilelessness to his older brother, who narrates the novelit pleases them to do so. But ointments and finery are helpless against the years. At 30 Nicholas the odalisque begins to resemble a tart; at 37 he is dead. His brother, summoned by Nicholas's landlady to collect the lapsed body and now-scarred valuables, looks back fondly, objectively and suggestively upon a life no longer valid once physical beauty is flawed. Sensual, mocking and deadly serious, this first novel casts a long shadow. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Come, Blackrobe: De Smet and the Indian Tragedy</h2><p>Father Killoren gives in this book a picture of the plight of the Native American peoples in the U.S., and of the work among them of Jesuit missionary Pierre Jean DeSmet. Beginning with the founding of the United States and focusing on the period of DeSmet&#39;s active missionary life (1823-73), Fr. Killoren examines the government&#39;s unfulfilled treaty obligations, the destruction of Indian land, and the subsequent devastation brought about by disease and famine. It is a story filled with immense tragedy and irony, and one wherein the government seemed to view either extermination or complete assimilation as the only policy options. Author: John J. Killoren, S.J.</p><p>In May 1823, 12 Jesuit priests arrived in St. Louis on a mission to Western Indian tribes to set up a Native Christian Empire, as developed by their order in Paraguay. One of the priests was a Belgian, Peter John DeSmet, who would become the beloved "Blackrobe" to two generations of Indian leaders. Killoran, a Jesuit who is now retired from the Indian Mission on the Wind River reservation in Wyoming, traces DeSmet's work and gives us a fresh perspective on the Western expansion and Indian-U.S. relations during the mid-19th century when the Jesuits built several missions across the Northern Great Plains. For nearly 50 years DeSmet divided his time between raising funds for Indian aid in Europe and the Eastern U.S. with visits to various Indian tribes. He remained their strong advocate in an era when official policy pointed toward extermination. This is a worthy contribution to Western history. Illustrated. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Peter John De Smet ("Blackrobe"), a young Jesuit missionary from Belgium, arrived in St. Louis, "where the rivers meet," in 1823. In the half-century that followed, friendships he formed with Native Americans of the Plateau and upper Missouri regions enabled him to become a trusted and effective advocate of Indian rights. Blackrobe held a pragmatic view of the future these groups faced when confronted by the surge of America's often illegal expansion into their territories. However, he decried the irrational and often inhuman policies imposed on the tribes by ignorant, land-hungry, ethnocentric Eastern politicians. Native studies and Western history collections will benefit from this chronicle of a beloved missionary's role during a time of cataclysmic change for Natives in the American West.<br><i>Mary B.

Adventurers, farmers, traders, conquerors and sailors, the Vikings were both peaceful and fierce, fighting or bargaining their way through as far as Constantinople in the East, North America and Greenland in the North, the British Isles in the West as well as into the Mediterranean. Throughout their existence, the Vikings encountered a remarkable diversity of peoples and inhabited an expansive and changing world. This beautifully illustrated book explores the core period of the Viking Age from a global perspective, examining how the Vikings drew influences from Christian Europe and the Islamic World and how they created a lasting historical impact on our world today. Highlighting an extraordinary range of objects and featuring new discoveries by archaeologists and metal-detector users, the cultural connections between Europe, Byzantium and the Middle East are explored in absorbing detail. Vikings: life and legend is published to complement a major exhibition developed jointly by the British Museum, the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen and the Museum for Prehistory and Early History, Berlin.</p><p><p> Gareth Williams is Curator of Early Medieval Coins at the British Museum.</p><p>"The book and the exhibition are visually stunning. . . . and the section on 'Belief and Ritual' is fascinating."&#x2015;Tom Shippey, <em>London Review of Books</em></p><br><br><p>"Much more than simply a lavish catalog to accompany the exhibition of the same name organized by the National Museum of Denmark, the British Museum, and the Museum f�r Vor- und Fr�hgeschichte, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin... this attractive, well-produced volume addresses a comprehensive array of subjects relevant to understanding the material and thought worlds of the Viking Age in northern Europe (roughly AD 750-1150)."&#x2015;Stephen Mitchell, <em>Speculum</em> (October 2015)</p><br><br><p>"A beautiful, accessible book, with strong interpretive narration that will be enjoyed by Viking enthusiasts, medievalists, artists interested in material culture, and newcomers to the subject."&#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)</p><br><br>"This volume was written to accompany an exhibition organized by the national museums of Britain, Denmark, and Germany. . . .

Vitale, assisted by Sports Illustrated writer Kirkpatrick, deals exclusively here with college games, and those who do not share his enthusiasm or who are not already fans of his will find his memoir unexceptional. He includes a brief look at his coaching career in junior high, high school, college and the pros, but devotes most of his attention to random observations about his hectic schedule, the best and the zaniest college coaches, the top teams and players of the 1980s, his proposal for a semi-pro league subsidized by the NBA and other controversial aspects of the game.

Launching a major new area for literary investigation, the book uncovered the long but neglected tradition of women writers in England. A classic of feminist criticism, its impact continues to be felt today.</p><br><p> This revised and expanded edition contains a new introductory chapter surveying the book's reception and a new postscript chapter celebrating the legacy of feminism and feminist criticism in the efflorescence of contemporary British fiction by women.</p></p><p>Readers of this new, enlarged edition of the classic feminist study of British women novelists will find themselves delighted by Elaine Showalter's astute and acerbic critical intelligence. Showalter is one of the few scholars who can make her readers rush to their bookshelves to refute her point, or simply to experience again <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, or the bitterly illuminating stories of Katherine Mansfield. Her chief innovation is to place the works of famous women writers beside those of the minor or forgotten, building a continuity of influence and inspiration as well as a more complete picture of the social conditions in which women's books have been produced. She has added a new introduction recounting, with justifiable pleasure, how daring and controversial her study seemed when it first appeared in 1977 (and how many enemies it made her). In an afterword, she touches on more recent developments in the women's novel in Britain, including the influence of the dazzling Angela Carter. <i>--Regina Marler</i><b>Elaine Showalter</b> is Avalon Foundation Professor of the Humanities and Professor of English at Princeton University.

All of the cases are different with respect to history, governmental structure, and economic situation. Yet all of the cases are similar in some ways&#x2014;they are close to the same size (in terms of population), operate within mature democratic political systems, have distinct secessionist political parties, and all reside within member states of the EU. Categorically, in all cases, there are also shared influences of the ability of the region to secede: institutions, interests, and ideas.</p><p>Glen M.E. Duerr is assistant professor of international studies at Cedarville University.Duerr traces the proper contours of a complex and multifaceted picture, allowing the reader to never lose their orientation in an authentic labyrinth of interviews, percentages and statistical data. In addition, thanks to an excellent use of transcripts of conversations with the principal leaders of the various secessionist parties, the author also manages to highlight the instruments of political struggle adopted by the various movements and how they intend to pursue their goals.... In a time of deep economic and social crisis, in a European context increasingly marked by mistrust and anti-systemic orientations characterised by the strong idea of leaving the Community path, the work of Duerr is a real beacon in the darkness. The author, in fact, not only provides an interesting point of view in one of the most controversial discussions in recent political science debates, also drawing a parallel history of the most important secessionist parties in Western Europe, but in doing so he provides his readers one of the most important contributions to the nationalism studies that have been published over the last twenty years. The success of Duerr also lies in having immediately decided to abandon the magniloquent and often intricate tones typical of some European political science literature, in favour of a flexible choice of language, easily understandable by the common reader, unaccustomed to international politics treaties or comparative political science essays...[T]he formula adopted by Duerr has been successful: easy language, a solid comparative approach (enriched, as already mentioned, by interesting interviews), a good amount of data in support of his arguments and a wide knowledge of the secessionist subject.... Secessionism and the European Union: The Future of Flanders, Scotland, and Catalonia remains an important and timely book, which deserves a wide readership. It will surely be of interest not only to scholars of political science but also to general readers with an interest in European contemporary history and politics. (<i>Nations and Nationalism</i>)<br><br>Secessionism and the European Union is a significant contribution to the literature on the evolving agendas of sub-state European parties, particularly those that have come to adopt the objective of independence.... The book is highly accessible, divided as it is into many short sections. (<i>European Political Science</i>)<br><br>In this timely book, Glen Duerr provides a thoughtful discussion of a crucial actor in the contemporary politics of secessionism in Western Europe: the secessionist party. Informed by several interviews with party representatives and officials, Duerr's study is an important contribution to the literature on nationalism. (Andr� Lecours, University of Ottawa)<br><br>The old countries of Europe, once thought to be settled, are in danger of breaking apart&#x2014;a development which would completely scramble the geopolitical calculus of this region and of the world. Dr. Glen Duerr does a masterful job in explaining the roots and reasons behind three of the most successful secessionist movements: Scotland, Flanders and Catalonia. In clear, accessible language, Duerr looks at the changing nature of national identities in these regions as they steer a transition from a narrowly based ethnic nationalism to a more inclusive civic nationalism. We have long needed a book like this. It will be invaluable for anybody interested in nationalism, international relations, and European studies.

Today, The Diary of a Young Girl has sold over 25 million copies world-wide. This edition accompanies the 2009 BBC TV series written by Deborah Moggach.It is one of the most celebrated and enduring books of the last century and it remains a deeply admired testament to the indestructible nature of human spirit.Anne Frank and her family fled the horrors of Nazi occupation by hiding in the back of a warehouse in Amsterdam for two years with another family and a German dentist. Aged thirteen when she went into the secret annexe, Anne kept a diary. She movingly revealed how the eight people living under these extraordinary conditions coped with hunger, the daily threat of discovery and death and being cut off from the outside world, as well as petty misunderstandings and the unbearable strain of living like prisoners.The Diary of a Yong Girl is a timeless true story to be rediscovered by each new generation.

She died in Bergen-Belsen, three months short of her sixteenth birthday.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Unconquered: A Novel</h2><p><b>Brilliant, outspoken, willful&#x2014;no one dared challenge stunning Miranda's wild ways . . .&nbsp;<br><br></b>Except Jared Dunham.

Sinking merchant ships with impunity, German U-boats threatened the lifeline between the United States and Britain, very nearly denying the Allies their springboard onto the European Continent--a loss that would have effectively cost the Allies the war.<p>In <i>Turning the Tide</i>, author Ed Offley tells the gripping story of how, during a twelve-week period in the spring of 1943, a handful of battle-hardened American, British, and Canadian sailors turned the tide in the Atlantic. Using extensive archival research and interviews with key survivors, Offley places the reader at the heart of the most decisive maritime battle of World War II.</p></p><p><b>Ed Offley</b> has been a military reporting specialist since 1981. He has worked for five separate newspapers and online publications. A graduate of the University of Virginia, Offley served in the U.S. Navy during Vietnam. He and his wife, Karen, live in Panama City Beach, Florida.&#x201c;<i>Turning the Tide</i> is a dramatic contribution to understanding of a long-running and geographically huge confrontation that may have mattered more to the outcome of World War II than more commented-on campaigns.... As important and engaging as the sweep and generalities of the largest naval campaign in history are, the bulk of this book, and Offley&#x2019;s signal contribution, is his first-hand, blow-by-blow descriptions of some of the deadliest and most game-changing encounters of the Atlantic war.... Offley skillfully blends history and statistics and analysis as well as heart-pounding narratives of sea-battles that have the immediacy of a good novel, only they tell of real people and real events. <i>Turning the Tide</i>...belongs on the bookshelves of professional historians or of general readers attempting to understand a central campaign in the most horrific war in human history.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Marc Milner, University of New Brunswick, author of&nbsp;<i>North Atlantic Run</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Battle of the Atlantic<br></i></b>&#x201c;Offley tackles a complex and difficult campaign spanning months across a vast ocean and involving a myriad of actors, and turns it into a compelling piece of writing. &nbsp;In a field where the outcomes of battles are often treated as mere statistics&#x2014;of tonnages sunk or shipping safely escorted&#x2014;or as evidence of the impact of technology, Offley&#x2019;s Atlantic tale is full of people wrestling with the sea, the enemy and their fate.&nbsp; In the end, <i>Turning the Tide</i> captures the human dimension of the crisis of the Atlantic War in the spring of 1943 in a way no one has for nearly forty years.&nbsp; And it is a welcome reminder that the Atlantic war lay at the heart of Allied victory in World War II.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Kirkus</i></b><i><br></i>&#x201c;Offley meticulously re-creates the terrifying U-boat assaults during this pivotal spring...and explains how the Allies turned the tide of the years-long battle....

To win, the allies needed just to survive, to carry desperately needed supplies to Europe. The miracle is these ships do far more. They turn the tide and pummel their tormentors in a moment of history that makes one hell of a story.&#x201d;</p><b>David Poyer, author of&nbsp;<i>Ghosting</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Crisis<br></i></b>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s left to add to the oft-told tale of the Battle of the Atlantic?&nbsp; Ed Offley manages to invest the story of the convoys&nbsp;with renewed drama.&nbsp; Buttressed with statistics and details of tactics and ordnance, <i>Turning the Tide</i> is worth a place on the shelf with the best maritime nonfiction.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>Michael Gannon, author of&nbsp;<i>Operation Drumbeat</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Black May<br></i></b>&#x201c;In this volume the author has selected a series of stories that both&nbsp;explicate and dramatize the most fateful months of the Allied-German battle for control of the North Atlantic in World War II.

The author&#x2019;s emphasis is on the harrowing experiences of the men on both sides.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Booklist</i></b>&#x201c;This sound, readable WWII naval history focuses on a crucial period of the Battle of the Atlantic, one Offley argues was the turning point in the campaign....

We follow each merchant vessel and each U-boat and understand what they are up to; but we also get a sense of what it must have been like for the submariner in his dank little world and the watchman on his sleet-flailed bridge.... [A] valuable book.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Philadelphia</i></b><b><i> Inquirer</i></b>&#x201c;When we think of World War II, we tend to think of two theaters of war: the European continent and North Africa, and the Pacific.... Far less attention has been paid to a third theater, the brutally cold, gale-slashed North Atlantic, where the British and American navies struggled against German U-boats to protect the supply lifeline that made the eventual Allied victory in Europe possible.<b></b>Ed Offley&#x2019;s well researched, tautly written account does its part to even the scales.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Carl LaVO, author of&nbsp;<i>Back from the Deep</i>,&nbsp;<i>Slade Cutter</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Galloping Ghost</i></b>&#x201c;Long before there was D-Day, there was D-Day in the North Atlantic Ocean for England.&nbsp; In <i>Turning the Tide</i>, Ed Offley delivers the definitive bible of how the Allies in March and May of 1943 turned defeat into victory against an armada of German U-boats determined to strangle resupply lines to England. The book delivers high suspense on the storm-tossed North Atlantic by taking readers inside the U-boats and the Allied convoys as well as American, English and German high commands racing for technological advantage at sea.&nbsp; In the end, Offley&#x2019;s masterful account not only probes what gave each side an edge but reveals the bravado it took for a rather small group of Allied and German sailors to fight to the death in one of history&#x2019;s great naval struggles.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ed Offley&#x2019;s new book <i>Turning the Tide</i> is a story few know in the history of World War II.

He brings his naval expertise to bear in describing each side&#x2019;s actions and perspectives during those pivotal encounters. Moreover, he does a masterful job of detailing the horrors of battle as brave men fought each other with fire and steel and also fought the ferocious and frigid waves in which many of them drowned.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>Virginia Gazette<br></i></b>&#x201c;[An] excellent new book.... Offley describes in clear and wonderful detail how the Allies did it.... [His] writing is superb, and his research in the text and in the appendices are clear and to the point.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The American Spectator</i></b></p><h2>The Street Politics of Abortion: Speech, Violence, and America&#39;s Culture Wars (The Cultural Lives of Law)</h2><p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court decision in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> stands as a historic victory for abortion-rights activists. But rather than serving as the coda to what had been a comparatively low-profile social conflict, the decision mobilized a wave of anti-abortion protests and ignited a heated struggle that continues to this day. </p> <p>Picking up the story in the contentious decades that followed <i>Roe</i>, The Street Politics of Abortion is the first book to consider the rise and fall of clinic-front protests through the 1980s and 1990s, the most visible and contentious period in U.S. reproductive politics. Joshua Wilson considers how street level protests lead to three seminal Court decisions&#x2015;<i>Planned Parenthood v. Williams, Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of Western N.Y.</i>, and <i>Hill v. Colorado</i>. The eventual demise of street protests via these cases taught anti-abortion activists the value of incremental institutional strategies that could produce concrete policy gains without drawing the public's attention. Activists on both sides ultimately moved&#x2015;often literally&#x2015;from the streets to fight in state legislative halls and courtrooms.</p> <p>At its core, the story of clinic-front protests is the story of the Christian Right's mercurial assent as a force in American politics. As the conflict moved from the street, to the courts, and eventually to legislative halls, the competing sides came to rely on a network of lawyers and professionals to champion their causes. New Christian Right institutions&#x2015;including Pat Robertson's American Center for Law and Justice and the Regent University Law School, and Jerry Falwell's Liberty University School of Law&#x2015;trained elite activists for their "front line" battles in government. Wilson demonstrates how the abortion-rights movement, despite its initial success with <i>Roe</i>, has since faced continuous challenges and difficulties, while the anti-abortion movement continues to gain strength in spite of its losses.</p></p><p>Joshua C.

He has also placed pieces in <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i>, <i>The Washington Post's Monkey Cage</i>, and elsewhere."<i>The Street Politics of Abortion</i> adds much to our understanding of dissent, abortion, politics, and the evolution of new Christian conservative leaders, institutions, and tactics." (Laura R. Woliver <i><i>Tulsa Law Review</i></i>)<br><br>"Beautifully written and tremendously accessible, <i>The Street Politics of Abortion</i> offers new insight into how lawyers&#x2015;especially those assigned to cases rather than taking them as part of their political commitments&#x2015;understand their role as trial lawyers and social movement actors. This excellent book is analytically important, methodologically innovative, and breaks new ground in the study of social movements, legal consciousness, and the first amendment." (Laura Beth Nielsen <i>Northwestern University, American Bar Foundation, author of <i>License to Harass: Law, Hierarchy, and Offensive Public Speech</i></i>)<br><br>"On about as hot a subject as a scholar can take on, Joshua Wilson has sensitively and exhaustively shown how activists' 'stories' about the law shape the everyday politics of abortion. Blending political science and sociology, this is modern legal scholarship at its very best." (Steven Teles <i>Johns Hopkins University, author of <i>The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement</i></i>)<br><br>"Joshua Wilson shows how the interactions of protesters at abortion clinics and their legal defeats actually helped to institutionalize the anti-abortion movement. This important new work on abortion politics greatly advances our understanding of movement/countermovement dynamics and the power of law." (Suzanne Staggenborg <i>University of Pittsburgh</i>)<br><br>"[The events of the American anti-abortion movement] are the subject of Joshua C. Wilson's book, <i>The Street Politics of Abortion</i>, and involve the intersection of four topics: political movements that involve litigation; anti-abortion activism; First Amendment doctrine and judicial decision making; and legal consciousnes, in particular the evolving view of law of various elite and non-elite actors. This combination makes for rich and fascinating subject of study and promises Wilson's book a wide audience . . . Wilson lets the various actors speak for themselves. As a result, the reader gets a good sense of the motivation and thinking of the activists on both sides."

Their aim was nothing less than to prove the superiority of the Aryan race, and with it the unique right of the German people to rule Europe. The occult figured as a key feature in many of these increasingly desperate quack &#x2018;research&#x2019; efforts. Part &#x2018;science,&#x2019; part espionage, and part fantasy. Archaeological expeditions were sent to Iceland, Tibet, Kafiristan, North Africa, Russia, the Far East, Egypt, and even South America and the Arctic.

He rewarded those academics that took part with high military office, whilst those academics who contradicted or criticized the SS-Anenerbe were carted off to concentration camps where they faced certain death.

What emerges is a story of courage, hubris, the agony of command, the weight of lives versus wealth, and the advances of science versus the terrible power and unpredictability of nature.</p></p><p>In October 1998, a wayward tropical storm blossomed into one of the most powerful hurricanes in modern history. When it finished its devastating course throughout the Caribbean, Hurricane Mitch had killed thousands of people, left hundreds of thousands more homeless, and destroyed whole towns. Journalist Jim Carrier turns up a small but telling incident: the disappearance of a 282-foot schooner called the Fantome. Guided by a young but accomplished English captain and manned by seasoned West Indian sailors, the cruise ship put into port in Belize to discharge its passengers, then set out to sea in an attempt to outrace a storm that, defying expectation, changed its course and in the end sent the Fantome and its crew beneath the waves. All that was terrible enough; added to it was the legal battle that awaited the crew's survivors, one that hung over the disaster "like a poisonous cloud." Following the Fantome's course hour by hour, Carrier covers all aspects of the incident thoroughly and sympathetically. His book makes a compelling companion to Sebastian Junger's <i>The Perfect Storm</i> as a fine reconstruction of a maritime tragedy, one that does honor to the unfortunate dead. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><p>"An outstanding book. Truly gripping and chilling."--Captain G. Andy Chase, Maine Maritime Academy </p><p>Built for luxury on a grand scale, the <i>Fantome</i> was a 282-foot, steel-hulled, four-masted schooner commissioned by the Duke of Westminster in the Roaring Twenties to idle along the French Riviera. She was rescued from mothballs in 1971 by self-made Miami entrepreneur Mike Burke, founder of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, Ltd., who purchased the tall ship from Aristotle Onassis. For the next twenty-seven years, the <i>Fantome</i> lumbered through the Caribbean, carrying passengers on weeklong fantasy cruises, spiced with rum and sun. </p><p>Captain Guyan March, thirty-two years old, had spent his entire professional career aboard Mike Burke's aging fleet of tall ships. When he agreed to command the <i>Fantome</i> in the uncrowded waters of the Gulf of Honduras during hurricane season, he knew that a storm would leave him little time to run and few places to hide. </p><p>In October 1998, as March and his crew--most of them West Indians and most still in their twenties--neared the end of another cruise season, Tropical Storm Mitch whirled to life like a nebula in the southern reaches of the Caribbean. While hurricane specialists in Miami struggled to decipher satellite photos and conflicting readings, Mitch moved north, then west, ultimately growing into the fourth most powerful Atlantic storm on record as it plowed toward the Gulf of Honduras. After discharging his 97 passengers in Belize, Captain March--with First Mate "Brasso" Frederick, Second Mate Onassis Reyes, and twenty-eight other crew--took the $20 million uninsured ship to sea to try to dodge the approaching storm. </p><p>Mitch would become the most destructive hurricane in Western Hemisphere history, leaving 18,207 people dead or missing. It would devastate Honduras. First, though, it would corner the <i>Fantome</i> in a deadly game of cat and mouse, confounding the experts' predictions and countering the ship's every move with eerie precision. Descending on the ship, it would expose every unexamined assumption to 180-mile-per-hour winds and 50-foot seas. </p><p>Based on journalist Jim Carrier's exhaustive research and hundreds of interviews--including Windjammer staff and passengers, the crew's families, and experts from the National Hurricane Center--<i>The Ship and the Storm</i> explores the story of the <i>Fantome</i> and Hurricane Mitch from every angle, cutting from the deck of the ship, to cruise company headquarters in Miami, to the research planes flying into the unspeakable heart of the storm, to islanders and coastal villagers in a desperate battle for survival. Heartbreaking and horrifying, this story won't let go.</p></p><h2>The Case of the Love Commandos (Vish Puri)</h2><p>In one of the ten best mysteries of the year (<i>Seattle Times</i>), private investigator Vish Puri becomes embroiled in a high-stakes mystery involving one of India&#x2019;s most controversial commodities: love.<br><br>When Ram and Tulsi fall in love, the young woman&#x2019;s parents are dead set against the union.

Young Tulsi&#x2019;s father locks her up and promises to hunt down the &#x201c;loverboy dog.&#x201d; Fortunately, India&#x2019;s Love Commandos, a real-life group of volunteers dedicated to helping mixed-caste couples, come to the rescue.

Laxmi&#x2014;the Commando&#x2019;s code name&#x2014;could make out the portly profile of the driver, the one who was so fond of chicken tikka, desi sharab and the accommodating ladies of the local bazaar.<br> <br>Next to him sat the goon with the gorilla nose and droopy eyes. He looked like he&#x2019;d have had trouble spelling his own name. But it would be a mistake to underestimate him, Laxmi noted. Naga, as he was known at his local gym, was a power-lifting champion with fists the size of sledgehammers.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re pulling up now,&#x201d; she said into her mobile phone, the line open to her fellow Love Commando volunteer Shruti, who was waiting inside the gymnasium building where the examinations were about to begin.<br> <br>It was ten minutes to four.<br> <br>The driver had kept his end of the bargain. Now Laxmi would have to live up to hers. Last night&#x2019;s surveillance video of his dalliance with that bar girl would not find its way into the hands of his wife after all.<br> <br>From behind the Licensed Refrigerated Water &#x201c;Trolly&#x201d; positioned across the road, she watched the driver alight. He looked up and down the busy street. Satisfied that the coast was clear, he opened the Range Rover&#x2019;s back door.<br> <br>The revulsion Laxmi felt for the driver paled in comparison to the contempt in which she held his boss, who emerged. Vishnu Mishra personified everything the Love Commandos were attempting to change about India. In north Indian parlance, he was known as a Thakur, literally &#x201c;lord&#x201d;&#x2014;a hereditary landowner with no qualms about exploiting the caste system that still doomed tens of millions of low-caste Indians to subjugation and poverty. His immaculate appearance despite Agra city&#x2019;s heat and dust owed everything to this gross imbalance. An army of servants attended to his every whim: cooks, cleaners, sweepers, even a personal barber&#x2013;cum&#x2013;shampoo wallah who kept his nails immaculate, buffed his skin and, rumor had it, dressed him in the morning. Managers oversaw the day-to-day running of his numerous commercial activities. His eldest son managed his political ambitions. And a mistress called &#x201c;Smoothy&#x201d; ensured that during many an afternoon in apartment 301D of Avalon Apartments, his carnal needs were sated.<br> <br>Mishra even had a ready vote bank of thirty thousand subjugated tenant farmers whom he maintained in a perpetual state of poverty and hunger.<br> <br>Still, there was one task he was evidently prepared to take care of himself: Vishnu Mishra was prepared to kill.<br> <br>As he climbed down from his Range Rover, Laxmi caught a flash of the semiautomatic inside his jacket.<br> <br>He stood for a few seconds, surveying the street and waiting for Naga to alight from the other side of the vehicle. Then he beckoned for his daughter to step out.<br> <br>This was the first time Laxmi had laid eyes on Tulsi. She&#x2019;d been under lock and key for the past three months in the family&#x2019;s Agra villa, barred from having contact with even her closest female friends. Indeed, the only visitors she&#x2019;d seen in all that time were prospective grooms and their families, all of them vetted and introduced by an &#x201c;upscale&#x201d; marriage broker.<br> <br>&#x201c;Beautiful, homely, fair and proper height&#x201d; was how Cupids Matrimonial Agency had described her. Laxmi could see that this was no exaggeration. Tulsi had mother-of-pearl skin and dark brown eyes set amidst a flurry of long black lashes. She looked to be in good health, with plenty of color in her cheeks. If she bore her father any ill will, it certainly didn&#x2019;t show in her doting smile.<br> <br>Had she buckled under the relentless pressure of parents and family? Laxmi wondered.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d known it to happen before. Tulsi&#x2019;s boyfriend, Ram, might have been a handsome boy with liquid brown eyes, but he was still an &#x201c;untouchable,&#x201d; or Dalit&#x2014;a caste so low and noxious to the highborn Hindu that, until recent times, the slightest physical contact with a member had been considered personally polluting.<br> <br>Vishnu Mishra would stop at nothing to prevent his daughter from seeing Ram again. He&#x2019;d blocked all communication between them and left the young man in no doubt about what would happen if he attempted to contact Tulsi again.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you at the earliest opportunity, Dalit dog,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d promised over the phone.<br> <br>But Ram hadn&#x2019;t been scared off. He&#x2019;d appealed to the Love Commandos for help. The charity helped Indian couples from disparate castes and religions to marry and settle down, often under aliases. The founders and volunteers believed that the arranged-marriage system was holding back society and that if young people were able to choose their own partners&#x2014;to marry across caste lines and therefore break down the ordained divisions once and for all&#x2014;then India would become a more progressive place.<br> <br>Laxmi, who&#x2019;d met with Ram a fortnight ago, had taken a shine to the young Dalit and his commitment to Tulsi.<br> <br>&#x201c;She has hair that smells like raat ki raani,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told her.<br> <br>Did Ram understand how hard it was for &#x201c;love marriage&#x201d; couples to make their way in Indian society without parental support? Did he comprehend how especially hard it would be for them given that Tulsi was from a Thakur family and he a Dalit one? Possibly not. &#x201c;Without blossoms there is no spring in life,&#x201d; he said, quoting from the poet Ghalib. Ram sounded na�ve, but Laxmi was willing to risk her life for the lanky love-struck student nonetheless.<br> <br>And what better place for the Love Commandos to strike again but Agra, home of the Taj Mahal, the world&#x2019;s greatest monument to love?<br> <br>Now the whole plan hung on whether Tulsi would be true to her feelings&#x2014;and whether she was brave enough.<br> <br>If she wanted to avoid an arranged marriage at the Harmony Farms wedding venue a week from today, then she would have to be. This was her only chance of escape, her finals being the one commitment Vishnu Mishra would ensure that she didn&#x2019;t miss.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s heading in now,&#x201d; Laxmi reported to Shruti. &#x201c;Be ready.&#x201d;<br> <br>Vishnu Mishra led Tulsi inside the examination hall past clutches of students. Naga followed a few steps behind. His steroid-enhanced muscles ensured that he moved like a gunslinger in an American Western, with legs splayed and arms hanging stiffly by his sides.<br> <br>The driver, meanwhile, stepped over to the Licensed Refrigerated Water Trolly and demanded a glass of nimboo pani. He gulped it down, some of the liquid trickling onto his stubbly chin, and eyed Laxmi, who was posing as the vendor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want to be Radha to my Krishna, baby?&#x201d; he said with a lecherous grin.<br> <br>She ignored him and he tossed a couple of coins onto the top of the cart before returning to the Range Rover.<br> <br>A few seconds later, her phone vibrated with an SMS. &#x201c;Dad&#x2019;s here!&#x201d; it read.<br> <br>Laxmi cursed under her breath. Vishnu Mishra had gone inside the examination hall. He must have come to an arrangement with the adjudicator&#x2014;no doubt a financial one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stick to plan,&#x201d; she messaged back before donning her helmet, jumping on her scootie and kick-starting the engine.<br> <br>Crossing over the road and mounting the pavement, she headed down the alleyway that ran alongside the gymnasium building. It was littered with chunks of loose concrete and dog turds. She pulled up beneath the window to the ladies&#x2019; toilets.<br> <br>A few minutes later, she received another SMS confirming that Tulsi had been slipped Ram&#x2019;s note asking her to run away with him.<br> <br>All Laxmi could do now was wait&#x2014;and pray.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>Forty-five minutes passed. Laxmi was beginning to give up hope when a set of painted fingernails appeared over the window ledge.<br> <br>A pair of anxious dark brown eyes followed. It was Tulsi.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you with Ram?&#x201d; she whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;ll take you to him!&#x201d; answered Laxmi.<br> <br>The Love Commandos had placed a bamboo ladder in the alley earlier that morning. She picked it up and leaned it against the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can do it!&#x201d; said Tulsi as she looked down.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve only got a few minutes before you&#x2019;re missed. Hurry!&#x201d;<br> <br>It took the young woman a couple of attempts to get one elbow up onto the windowsill. The other followed. Then a foot.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, you&#x2019;re almost there!&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then, there was a thud inside the toilets&#x2014;a door slamming against the wall. A man&#x2019;s voice shouted, &#x201c;What the hell? Get down!&#x201d;<br> <br>He grabbed Tulsi by the leg and tried to pull her back inside, but she kicked. &#x201c;No, Papa! Stop! Let me go!&#x201d;<br> <br>Laxmi heard another thud&#x2014;Vishnu Mishra falling backwards into a toilet cubicle&#x2014;and suddenly Tulsi was free and scrambling out the window.<br> <br>Within seconds, she&#x2019;d reached the bottom and Laxmi sent the ladder clattering to the ground. Mishra&#x2019;s curses rained down on the two women as they clambered onto the scootie and sped away down the alley, slaloming through the debris.<br> <br>They reached the front of the gymnasium to find the pavement occupied by a crowd of students demonstrating against poverty, chanting and holding up placards that read: IF I GIVE CHARITY YOU CALL ME A SAINT, IF I TALK ABOUT POVERTY YOU CALL ME A COMMUNIST!<br> <br>Honking her horn and motioning the students out of the way, Laxmi wove between them.<br> <br>Out of the corner of one eye, she spotted Naga bursting out of the gymnasium doors. He pushed through the crowd and knocked over three or four students. &#x201c;Stop!&#x201d;<br> <br>He would have caught her had it not been for Laxmi&#x2019;s colleague Sanjoy, a third Love Commando volunteer, who&#x2019;d been mingling with the students.<br> <br>Stepping forward, a can of pepper spray at the ready, he nailed the goon right in the face.<br> <br>Naga reared up, roaring like a wounded animal, clasping his hands to his face, and staggered away. Sanjoy then climbed onto the back of the scootie and he, Tulsi and Laxmi sped off toward the main gate.<br> <br>Behind them Vishnu Mishra ran into the middle of the street. He was wielding his revolver and gesticulating wildly to his driver to start the engine. But the man was fast asleep at the wheel of the Range Rover. The knockout pill Laxmi had slipped into his nimboo pani had done the trick.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>The trio passed beneath the red sandstone ramparts of Agra Fort and crossed the sluggish, polluted waters of the Yamuna River. Between the iron supports of the bridge, they glimpsed the gleaming white marble of the Taj Mahal before plunging headfirst into a maze of filthy alleys and lanes as cramped and teeming as an ant colony. The shop fronts of ironmongers, jewelers, dried-fruit sellers and cigarettepaan vendors interspersed with light industry units housing ironworks, printers and cardboard recyclers all appeared in rapid succession like the frames of a cartoon viewed through a Victorian zoetrope. Motorbikes and three-wheelers bullied their way through a multitude of pedestrians, cows and goats. Children spun metal bicycle wheels along the ground with sticks. At a water pump, men wearing chuddies lathered themselves in suds.<br> <br>Tulsi bore the stench of raw sewage and diesel fumes and potholes without complaint. Only after they&#x2019;d emerged into a landscape of houses dotted amongst virgin paddy fields on the edge of the city did she call out, &#x201c;Where are we going? Where&#x2019;s Ram?&#x201d;<br> <br>The answer was a nondescript building of red brick that served as the Love Commandos safe house.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we got away!&#x201d; gushed Tulsi as she dismounted from the scootie, shaking with fear and excitement. &#x201c;Oh my God, I don&#x2019;t know how to thank you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Laxmi didn&#x2019;t respond. Her attention was focused on the front door of the building. It was hanging, broken, from its hinges.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Ram inside? Can I see him?&#x201d; asked Tulsi.<br> <br>&#x201c;Keep her here,&#x201d; Laxmi instructed Sanjoy as she stepped forward to investigate.<br> <br>Pushing the door aside, she discovered a flower pot lying shattered in the corridor beyond. In the room where Ram had been staying, there were signs of a struggle. His new pair of black shoes, purchased for his impending wedding, had been thrown at the assailants who&#x2019;d broken in. There were a few spots of blood on the concrete floor as well.<br> <br>Laxmi searched the rest of the house, fearful of finding a body, but it was empty.<br> <br>Somehow&#x2014;God only knew how&#x2014;Vishnu Mishra&#x2019;s people had finally tracked Ram down. They&#x2019;d waited until he was alone and then grabbed him. That, surely, was the only explanation.<br> <br>Laxmi went outside to break the bad news to Tulsi.<br> <br>Her face fell and turned pale. &#x201c;Pa will kill him!&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Oh my God! I&#x2019;ve got to talk to him!&#x201d;<br> <br>Laxmi handed the young woman her phone.<br> <br>Tulsi&#x2019;s hands shook, but she managed to dial the number. &#x201c;Please pick up, Pa. Please, please, please,&#x201d; she kept saying.<br> <br>Laxmi put her head close to the phone so she could eavesdrop on the conversation.<br> <br>The call was answered by a gruff male voice. &#x201c;Who is this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tulsi&#x2019;s answer caught in her throat. &#x201c;Paaaa&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I&#x2019;m&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. soooo&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. saaarreee,&#x201d; she wept.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are you, beta?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t hurt him, Pa. I&#x2019;m begging you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurt who?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tulsi let out a couple of long, hard sobs. &#x201c;Raaaaam!&#x201d; she wailed. &#x201c;I love him sooo much!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen, I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about. Now I&#x2019;m going to come and get you. Tell me where you are. I&#x2019;m not angry. Your mother and I want you home&#x2014;that is all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tulsi wiped her wet cheeks and managed to compose herself. &#x201c;Let me speak with Ram first,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I want to know he&#x2019;s all right. Let him go and I&#x2019;ll come home. Papa, I&#x2019;ll never forgive you if anything happens to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen to me very carefully, beta. I don&#x2019;t know where he is. And I don&#x2019;t care. My only concern is your future. Tell me your exact location immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying, Pa. He&#x2019;s not here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is here? Tell me! I&#x2019;m your father!&#x201d;<br> <br>Laxmi grabbed the phone and disconnected the call.<br> <br>She and Tulsi stared at each other, confusion and disbelief writ across their faces.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did he say?&#x201d; asked Sanjoy, who looked equally baffled.<br> <br>&#x201c;He says he doesn&#x2019;t have Ram,&#x201d; said Laxmi.<br> <br>&#x201c;You believe him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He sounded genuine,&#x201d; said Tulsi.<br> <br>One of the neighbors, whose house stood a couple of hundred yards away, pedaled past on his bicycle. Had he seen anything? Laxmi asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A black SUV with tinted windows was parked here earlier.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you see who was inside?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two men got out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What did they look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was too far away.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you see anyone leave with them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A young man, I think. They dragged him out of the house.&#x201d;<br> <br>Laxmi thanked the neighbor and hurried back into the safe house to grab her bag. She emerged again to find Tulsi in a flood of tears.<br> <br>&#x201c;I should just go home. That way no one will get hurt,&#x201d; she said, gripped by grief.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s the answer,&#x201d; said Laxmi as she tried to comfort her. &#x201c;Now, listen: I promise we&#x2019;ll get to the bottom of this. For all we know Ram was taken by someone hoping to get a reward from your father. I&#x2019;ve a friend who can help&#x2014;a private detective. In the meantime I need to get you somewhere safe. You&#x2019;re going to have to trust me. Will you do that?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tulsi thought for a moment and then gave a nod. They remounted the scootie.<br> <br>&#x201c;We should split up,&#x201d; Laxmi told Sanjoy. &#x201c;Rendezvous at the bus station in three hours.

Helen Dunmore, winner of the Orange Prize, heightens sometimes overly obvious drama with rich, sensual prose.The story of two sisters who may have had a hand in their brother's death, British writer Dunmore's first novel to be published in the US, combines the suspense of a Hitchcock thriller with a captivating family drama. Nina loves London, but she's relieved to be invited out to the English countryside to help her ailing older sister, Isabel, after the difficult birth of the latter's first child. A wonderful cook who prefers to fix problems rather than talk about them, Nina, an artist and photographer, longs to make herself useful in the home of the beautiful sister she's always idolized. Others have arrived to help as well: Richard, Isabel's concerned but itinerant economist husband; Susan, a young baby-sitter who's just finished her nanny course; and Isabel's best friend, Edward, a homosexual who causes his share of resentment by keeping Isabel all to himself day and night for heart-to-heart chats in her room. The more the adults rub shoulders in the lovely house near the sea, the more the fissures between them become apparent. The weaknesses of Isabel's marriage are exposed when she orders Richard to sleep downstairs and subtly encourages his sexual interest in her sister. Susan, meanwhile, seems to want to keep baby Antony for herself, and Edward all but accuses the others of selfishly looking after their own petty needs while sweet Isabel languishes. The deepest, most horrifying family secret emerges only gradually in fragmentary images, as Nina begins to recall the demise of her infant brother when Isabel was seven and Nina four. Could Isabel have murdered that baby in a fit of sibling jealousy? If so, could she murder again? Nina struggles to remember what really happened during their childhood as time runs out for Antony and as the webs of family intrigue tighten around her. Sophisticated, sensual, frightening, and remarkably visual: a first-rate debut. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this stage there is no duality or otherness, but instead infinitude, the Original Oneness, from which all dualities and attributes emanate. The book is at once an autobiography, a didactic treatise and a literary opus full of wonderful translations of the words of earlier Sufis, as well as the author's own poetry. It describes Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri&#x2019;s life quest to connect today&#x2019;s world with classical times, especially through his meetings with enlightened Sufis all over the globe. Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri also addresses profound Sufi teachings concerning the nature of humankind, the cosmos and God, using clear and simple language to address difficult doctrinal issues as only a master who has digested fully such knowledge could do. The book also reveals much about the present-day Islamic world where, despite the tragedies that are to be seen everywhere, tradition and spirituality survive.

Drawing on this endless fascination with an individual often called the first American mountain man, this book offers an innovative, comprehensive study of a unique figure in American history. Despite his prominent role in the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the early exploration of the West, Colter is distinctly different from Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson, and the other legends of the era because they all left documents behind that allow access to the men themselves. Colter, by contrast, left nothing, not a single letter, diary, or reminiscence, so that second-, third-, or fourth-hand accounts of his adventures are all we have. Guiding readers through this labyrinth of hearsay, rumor, and myth, this is the first book to tell the whole story of Colter and his legend, examining everything that is known&#x2014;or supposedly known&#x2014;about Colter and showing how historians and history buffs alike have tried in vain to get back to Colter the man, know what he said and feel what he felt, but have ended up never seeing him clearly, finding instead an enigma they cannot unravel.</p><p>Ronald M.

Colter is frequently cited as the discoverer of Yellowstone and holds a legendary reputation for outrunning a tribe of lackfoot Indians hell-bent on hunting him down like an animal, a feat for which the yearly Colter&#x2019;s Run foot race in Montana is named. Yet, because Colter left behind almost no written documents, such as journals or letters, precious little is known about the explorer&#x2019;s life other than information gleaned from second- and third-hand accounts. . . .[The authors] devote themselves to separating the myths from the facts while offering fascinating tidbits about other people associated with Colter, such as Lewis and Clark. Readers new to Colter will be intrigued, while those familiar with his standing will be pleased to finally see a definitive biography of this noteworthy American pioneer. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>John Colter often 'travelled day and night' into uncharted territory like fellow 19th-century frontiersmen Daniel Boone, Simon Kenton, and Samuel Brady. Unlike those 'other mythmakers of the era,' however, who 'left documents behind that allow access to the men themselves,' Colter apparently left nothing. To pull together this volume on his feats and his forays into what would become Yellowstone National Park, authors Anglin and Morris relied on second- and third-hand accounts to give Colter his due and satisfy their own curiosity about his achievements. Among those from Kentucky handpicked by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to journey westward toward the Pacific, Colter had 'an exceptional sense for survival' and an instinct for direction. A rugged backwoodsman, he could endure 'fatigue, privations, and perils,' and had also 'learned how to track men and animals.' Colter later became the first white man to go into Yellowstone, and the authors address how and why he went, and what he experienced along the way. Anglin and Morris make a valiant effort to tell Colter&#x2019;s fascinating, if complicated, story and celebrate his legacy.

And yet through his connection with the great artists of his day, it was inevitable that Lord would himself become the object of the artist's gaze. In fact, from the time he was a young man, Lord sat for many of the major and minor painters and photographers of his day, including Balthus, Cocteau, Cartier-Bresson, Freud, Giacometti, and Picasso&#x2015;in all but one case at the artist's request. In<i> Plausible Portraits</i>, Lord gathers, alongside these images, his reflections, penetrating the mind of artist and model alike in a sequence of illuminating double portraits of two masters at work.</p></p><p><b>James Lord (1922-2009)</b> first went to France at age twenty-one as a member of the Military Intelligence Service during World War II. He spent the major part of his life in Paris, where he was acquainted with many of the most prominent members of modern European art. In recognition of his contribution to French culture he has been made an officer of the Legion of Honour. His books include <i>A Giacometti Portrait </i>and <i>My Queer War</i>.Plausible Portraits of James Lord <br> PICASSO Pablo Picasso was the preeminent portraitist of his period. In terms merely of quantity he was probably the preeminent portraitist of all time. And from the first, the features he most consistently commanded his talent to portray were his own. Already well before the age of twenty he had produced self-portraits inscribed, "I, the King." His passionate infatuation with self-representation knew no boundary, and over the coming three-quarters of a century thousands of images of himself in various guises spilled spontaneously from his fingertips. Even when he was portraying his wives, mistresses, children, friends, and casual passersby, he usually did so in such a manner that they were recognizable initially as Picassos and almost incidentally as individuals. Still, he could create arresting likenesses when he chose to. Indeed, it may almost have seemed that when he chose to he could create almost anything. In fact, he was sometimes heard to exclaim, "I'm God! I'm God!" This was even more exalting than to be king, and self-portraits were certainly to be viewed as objects entitled to devout veneration as the artist came closer and closer to the ultimate desecration of the model. His hubris, however, did not vouchsafe the immortal doom of atragic hero. He was too frightened by death to live on as a mythic figure. For all the illusory glory of his own lifetime, he had made so extravagant an outlay that even the fortune of the wealthiest artist in history could defray not a tithe of a tithe. Immense amounts of money have been paid for a Picasso self-portrait, but there precisely is the pitiless paradox. About the man's genius there is no question, and yet his commitment to the timeless truth of art was never sufficiently selfless to beget an artist able to further art's inherent capacity to become the redeeming element in human experience. This is not to imply that Picasso added little to the spiritual adventure of a direly troubled century. He added much. He added astonishing works of art, as to which, however, an uncertain future has still to make enduring assessments. He added an insatiable, almost maniacal and abject hunger for fame, leading to such a craven failure of integrity as fatefully falls upon a man--formerly the outspoken hero of creative freedom--prepared to support and praise without a murmur of remorse during the final third of his long lifetime a regime never surpassed for obscene evil: the Soviet Union. He added, when far too much has already been said, when what has been done has parlously been overdone, contradicted, exaggerated, and made meretricious, he added in a word, Picasso. The quest for the self secreted behind that name played upon an imperious disposition to invent rather than to discern the unique and enigmatic human who gazes inscrutably back from behind those famous eyes so repeatedly portrayed as Picasso, Plato, Praxiteles, Bacchus, and Adonis, the philosopher, the clown, minotaur and toreador, harlequin, painter, poet, lover, juggler of beauty and ugliness, a man of whom everyone has heard but nobody knows, creative daredevil who plays metaphysical tricks on na�ve mankind, leaving in his wake works of art that do--or do they?--suspend all doubt in regard to the principle of illusion. Doubt, indeed, was Picasso's principal plaything, because he, all alone in his omniscient absoluteness, put an end to five hundred years of lovely confidence in the redeeming ideal of art as the lifeblood of the whole human community. Overnight the quest for the self could successfully be completed by the simple assertion, "I do, therefore I am." No cerebral activity was required. The offspring of those who had been scurrilous about van Gogh now crowded forward to consecrate excrement alongside nothingness in the pantheon of creative plenitude. Picasso is reputed to have remarked that he could draw as well as Raphael. Even as a bon mot it was no good. He could convincingly imitate Ingres if he felt like it. He could even sometimes impart to a tangle of lines the quick of life. He was amazing. But in and of and for and by himself he allowed his genius to use him in order to substantiate the dehumanization of the very ground upon which he had chosen to stake his own humanity and its otherworldly perpetuation. He was too sly not to know this, and the knowledge is pathetically self-evident in the pitiful self-portraits of the artist's final years. He was terrified of dying, having been too callous during his lifetime to envision the beauty of oblivion. Where in his <i>Inferno</i> Dante would have placed Picasso is a matter for tantalizing, somber, and lamentable conjecture. Why today I take the liberty of articulating notions so long ago left idle is probably a simple surrender to the temptation of having a final fling with half a century's cumulative but supererogatory musings, which, of course, have everything to do with the possession,the pertinence, and the power of portraits, their maker and their model. Of all such intimations, to be sure, I had not the slightest inkling in war-worn Paris in the month of December 1944, when I braced my brashness at the pinpoint of Picasso's doorbell. As to the durable changes in my life brought about by pressing it, I have quite sufficiently described them elsewhere, albeit without dwelling very much on the issue of portraiture per se, though the two drawings made of me by Picasso are by no means unmentioned. The treacherous seductiveness of a portrait had never before tempted my introspective vulnerability. To be sure in that long-ago, grisly autumn I had lived with the propinquity of death as never before or after. My own transformation into a corpse did not at the time seem likely, of course, because soldiers take their personal survival for granted. Besides, I was seldom in any danger. Dying, however, was very much on my mind, in my dreams and before my eyes, a single visit to a field hospital scarring one's visual remembrance more than enough to last a lifetime. But I looked for forgetfulness, too, in the belief that art could confer the only kind of immortality worth living for. Rembrandt, Beethoven, Balzac. Oh, I scanned the heavens, didn't I? And yet it's true, it's absolutely true I had no idea what my mind was doing, but it did believe in the grand hypothesis of greatness if I could but approach it, see it for myself, touch it, even possess the proof. Yes, my outrageous desire was merely to amount to more than James Lord could ever hope to, foolish boy. The really redeeming geniuses, however, were inconveniently immortal already. Nevertheless there was one who certifiably did live and create in the very land where worldwide insanity had sent me. So there <i>was</i> someexistential cause concealed within the purpose, not to mention the propriety, of pressing Picasso's doorbell. The first portrait which at my request he, or anyone else, for that matter, ever made of me was drawn during lunch in a restaurant called Le Catalan several days after the fateful tinkle of the bell. Genius is wont to fight shy of conquests that are too easy. To capture a likeness is one thing, to accept its surrender is very definitely another. I had made the acquaintance of a great artist, the most famous and emblematic of his era, and been given a portrait of myself from his hand, tangible proof--was it not?--that my person had commanded the scrutiny of a genius. Such consummation, I realized, comes to very few, and so I might naturally have assumed that in this domain of craving I had nothing further to desire, that my quest for vision into the self had gloriously been consummated. But no, this was only the beginning. To start with, Picasso's portrait was a piercing disappointment. The secret self had evidently--and blindly--foreseen something altogether more comprehensive. In my diary I described the drawing as "A quick little sketch dashed off during lunch." That it happened to be a Picasso did not appear to provide what was wanted in the realm of revelation. The artist's attention and creative faculties clearly had not been engaged very deeply either by his model or by his drawing while I sat before him in the restaurant. I saw in my portrait evidence principally of haste and indifference--its inadequacy, not my own. The rendering of the GI-cut hair, the ear, the body, eye, and eyebrow, to be sure, is perfunctory. Not so the profile, however, which is aquiver, especially the mouth, vivid with feeling. And I didn't possess the insight to see what, in fact, I had beensearching for. As a likeness, it's true, the portrait lacks much resemblance to the model. However, on the evidence of his drawing, Picasso appears to have glimpsed in me something similar to my own sentimental view of his Blue Period pictures of wistful harlequins and romantic acrobats, several of whom I'd fallen in love with five years before. The pensive, slightly melancholy, ambiguous aspect of my profile, and in particular the physically awkward but aesthetically effective depiction of the left shoulder hunched upward before the chin, seemed designed to compose an image imbued by the same narcissistic pathos I had thought to discern in Picasso's youthful art as a reflection of my adolescent self-indulgence and sensual desperation. Perhaps it's just as well that I didn't yet perceive what pursuit had led me to the rue des Grands-Augustins or suspect what wizardry enabled Picasso to see what I really wanted and give it to me by making a portrait so peculiarly like an evocation of <i>his</i> youth, not mine. In the catalogue of the 1939 exhibition whereby Picasso had first gotten me excited, I had underlined a statement by the artist: "A picture lives a life like a living creature, undergoing the changes imposed upon us by our life from day to day. This is natural enough, as the picture lives only through the man who is looking at it." He might have done well to add that the man who is looking is looked at. And I see now, fifty-eight years later, that that first portrait of me by Picasso makes a more visible demand upon the reality and vision of an old man than ever could have been expected of a youth. The youth, meanwhile, having been relegated far from the battlefield to a bourgeois backwater in Brittany, engaged nonetheless in mental strife with his craving to be portrayed once again--and to his enduring satisfaction this time--by the baffling genius in Paris. Never for an instant did it occur to me that I might not chance to find myself once more in the presence of the indispensable artist. Nobody, I believe, having met him but once face-to-face, or knowing only his pictures, after all, could thereafter realistically foresee a time when Picasso might cease to loom over the perspective of things to come. As a prelude to dreams which I foreordained to be obedient, I puzzled and pondered about an infallible stratagem that might work like sunshine when in reply to my request Picasso would inevitably remark that his mastery of portraiture had been exercised to my advantage already. The only thinkable retort, I decided, would have to be misfortune. Unspeakable, ambiguous misfortune, its specific nature best left to the conjecture of an incomparable creator. This, of course, was before technology had begun to destroy the human imagination. To a man who lived in intimacy with the likes of Ovid and Aristophanes, the mere suggestion of misfortune could hardly be set aside as an effective cause. And it worked like magic, which it was, when eventually I asked him in front of three or four other men to draw once again my portrait. The conclusive inducement, I think, was nothing better than audacity, the stark, staring audacity of ingenuous awe. This time there was to be no mistake about the size of the paper I had brought with me or the quality of the pencil. But there must have been a determining difference. Not in my physical appearance, I assume, but in an inner one. Several months had passed, during which, dismissed from Brittany, I had been involved in the frantic misery and accidental fates of prisoners and victims of war, and this had further afflicted what equanimity I had left. Who can say thatthis was visible? It so happened that at the very same time Picasso was working on an enormous painting which depicted a scene of atrocity, dead bodies in a ghastly heap, limbs disjointed, gruesome features twisted and contorted, a vision appallingly reminiscent of the prison camp so recently my place of "work," where weeping men clawed for a sip of water while others died of hunger in the mud. Neither I nor the artist referred to such aspects of civilization's dismemberment, but it existed. He took the pencil, folded in half the sheet of paper, and told me to be seated on a chair some six feet away. My left profile was turned to him, so I couldn't tell how intently or how long he looked at me before beginning to draw. Not very long, because I quickly heard the pencil hissing on the paper, slowly at first, then faster, as if with a deliberate fury, while I hoped that this would go on forever, and then the whole business was done in less than five minutes. Picasso tossed the paper onto a nearby table. The witnesses crowded in front of me to see what had been drawn, and Sabartes, the artist's dour secretary, cried, "The latest masterpiece!" That exclamation embarrassed the model, but apparently no one else, least of all the artist. When I saw the drawing, I saw instantly--and at the time, perhaps, only--that it was what I had wanted. It was large, it looked like a likeness, and bore no resemblance whatever to the sketch dashed off in a restaurant sixteen weeks before. I thanked the artist as he rolled up the drawing and slipped a rubber band around it. For all response he simply shrugged. When I went toward the door to leave, Picasso came with me and kissed me on both cheeks as I bent toward him to say goodbye. This certainly, was the beginning of an intimidating sort of friendship that was to last for a decade. I acquired a portfolio to protect the portrait, plusits predecessor, and carried them with me everywhere until the war was over, then back to America, then back to France, where I will remain as long as Paris survives. It has been with me always, though I gave the original ten years ago to the Picasso Museum here, a gesture that merits some musing, but to forestall complete privation I had an excellent facsimile made, very nearly indistinguishable from Picasso's own handiwork when framed under glass. So I have not lost my relation to a likeness. A masterpiece is a work of whatever sort produced by an unquestioned master of the discipline entailed in its production. Whether or not Sabartes was right in so describing Picasso's second portrait of me I dare not say, but he was a lifelong connoisseur of the artist's work, and later, when we had become friendly, he once told me that he knew of no other portrait similar to mine in its bare linear volume and power limned with such sharp clarity of feeling conveyed as a kind of gleam refracted from my young sensibility, adding, moreover, that no other artist living--or dead?--could have produced an equivalent aesthetic vision of tenderness and determination. Oh, he added, he seemed to recall some vague resemblance to a sketch of the artist's son, Paulo, poring over a schoolbook, drawn about 1935 or 1936, but it was not nearly so stark and spirited. These were not his exact words, but they accurately enough convey the sense of what he said that summer afternoon and all I later recorded in my diary. Sabartes was a Romantic poet manque, his life entirely dependent on Picasso's, who treated him with affectionate derision, and when he showed me with tremendous pride the portraits drawn of him by his employer, I sad...</p><h2>Charlton Heston Presents the Bible</h2><p>A heartwarming collection of stories from the King James Bible retold by the author contains more than one hundred works of art, fifty photographs of the Holy Land, new perspectives on the Scriptures, and historical maps, in an inspirational book that makes the Bible come alive.</p><p></p><h2>Wittenberg - Acting Edition</h2><p>Join the jury as two of history�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most stubborn intellectuals go head-to-head in an entertaining battle of reason versus faith.</p><p>"Clever, argumentative, funny and thoughtful it has a wicked wit.

Within that period all Maxwell&#39;s strengths and weakness were exemplified - outwardly his empire was at the height of its glory - but the secrets about fraud and lies were about to be revealed.

Owing to Paul Mellon&#x2019;s interest in this genre, the VMFA&#x2019;s collection comprises not only British but also American and French works. With Country Pursuits: Sporting Art from the Mellon Collections in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Malcolm Cormack provides a consideration of these three national traditions, combined for the first time in one book. Presenting an in-depth survey of sporting art that is supported by catalog-style entries and corresponding color reproductions, this lavish coffeetable book also represents the work of each nationality in its own section.</p><p>Containing animal studies and scenes of horse racing, foxhunting and coursing, shooting and fishing, coaching and carriages, and other country pursuits, by artists such as George Stubbs, John Wooton, Sir Alfred J. Munnings, Alfred de Dreux, and George Catlin, this volume also offers a major introductory essay in which the author addresses the definition of sporting art with a particular emphasis on British artists in the context of prevailing artistic trends. Destroying the myth that only a coarse class of country squires collected sporting pictures, a separate section on British patronage describes the social and political context of sporting art.</p><p>Including biographies of the artists found in the Mellon collections and an index, Country Pursuits is a truly handsome collection for the sporting art enthusiast.</p></p><p><p>After serving as the Curator of Paintings at the Yale Center of British Art, Malcolm Cormack became Paul Mellon Curator at the VMFA in 1991 until his retirement in 2004. He has lectured at Cambridge and Yale and is the author of books and exhibition catalogues on Constable, Turner, Reynolds, and Bonington.

Gabriel Huntley witnesses in a dark alley sparks a chain of events that will take him to the ends of the Earth and beyond--where what is real and what is imagined become terribly confused.

This volume, designed by Marian Bantjes, is the largest collection of <i>Grimms' Fairy Tales</i> ever illustrated by a fine artist. Frank's irreverent palette, sophisticated use of color and inventive depiction of these dark narratives capture the original stories with a contemporary and unflinching eye. Each of the tales opens with a hand-drawn title page and is framed by a unique border; small drawings punctuate each story in the tradition of classic fairy-tale editions. The foremost Grimm scholar, Jack Zipes, introduces the book.</p><p>In these images, everything seems to be happening at once, as if a swirl of disparate actions...were sweeping one along without allowing time to question things. As in the tales themselves, the accent is more on the wonder at strange and possibly incomprehensible events than on revulsion or regret over their often dire consequences. No one's identity is securely established, no contradiction disallowed in Frank's magical realism. (Barry Schwabsky <i>Artforum</i>)<br><br>Frank takes the stories apart to uncover their most sinister scenes, rendering them with surreal, nightmarish flourishes. Digging into their subtexts, Frank unmasks these tales as the twisted, misogynistic fantasies they always were. (Paul Laster <i>Time Out New York</i>)<br><br>The numinous, jarring color and attention to gleefully monstrous details is masterful. Certainly no other artist of her generation has done as much with pastel. Drawing is central to her work, and with that comes the possibility of inventiveness. (John Yau <i>Hyperallergic</i>)<br><br>Tales of the Brothers Grimm, Drawings by Natalie Frank&nbsp;is an impressive tome with marvelous attention to detail.&nbsp; Frank&#x2019;s work is represented in private collections and museums in the United States. This book has all of the makings and quality to become a collector&#x2019;s item for people who enjoy books that are&nbsp;beautifully&nbsp;printed and filled with commanding illustrations. (Richard Rivera <i>New York Journal of Books</i>)<br><br>It was always a toss-up as to which was more alarming&#x2015;the stories themselves or the beautiful, terrifying drawings&#x2015;but I&#x2019;m so excited to have this book on my shelves for a long time to come. (Hilary Lawlor <i>The Improbable</i>)<br><br>Frank&#x2019;s illustration &#x2015; included in the ravishing book Tales from the Brothers Grimm: Drawings by Natalie Frank but unfortunately omitted from the exhibition &#x2015; shows us his gruesome treasury, a bazaar of dismembered limbs and human trophy heads arranged in a room decorated with pretty stripes. A blue face with smelly-fish eyes and a dumbly open mouth lingers in the memory. (Ariella Budick <i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>Frank&#x2019;s paintings always tend to have a narrative feel to them anyway&#x2013;the experience akin to reading some kind of meticulous and elegant horror comic book, with the panels stacked on top of each other, Bacon&#x2019;s popes meet Guernica&#x2013;but here every page dances with color and emotion. (Dan Duray <i>ARTnews</i>)<br><br>When looking at the stunningly impressionistic paintings of Natalie Frank, you wouldn&#x2019;t immediately guess that you&#x2019;re staring into the world of Grimm&#x2019;s Fairy Tales. Yet that is indeed the subject matter of her latest gallery show, aptly titled The Brothers Grimm, though not without the wildly evocative and dark touch of Frank&#x2019;s lurid imagination. (Jake Boyer <i>Milk Made</i>)<br><br>Represented by Chicago dealer Rhona Hoffman and L.A. dealers ACME, the artist has set herself apart with traditional painting techniques that she fuses with modern abstract styles and a vibrant palette. Her work often explores contemporary discourse on the body, feminism, sexuality, the grotesque, and the domestic sphere. For the Grimms, her characters are raw, at times rough, and always a study in opposites: soft and sensual flesh, with piercing realistic eyes, caught up in furious line work, contorted bodies, and violent tragedy. But like the stories themselves, all the images still contain a bit of humor. (Alanna Martinez <i>Observer</i>)<br><br>The lurid palette&#x2015;rich in pinks, greens, blues, and yellows&#x2015;creates the phantasmagoric atmosphere: part haunted house, part fun house. Animals and humans are frequently embedded within the same distorted figures. Nudity is common. Eyes, arms, and other body parts float in midair. Skeletons lounge next to the living. (Katya Kazakina <i>Bloomberg News</i>)</p><h2>My House in M�laga</h2><p>In 1934 Sir Peter Chalmers Mitchell retired at the age of 70 from a distinguished career as Secretary of the Zoological Society of London. During his tenor he had been the driving force behind the creation of the Whipsnade Zoo, which opened in 1931. He moved to M�laga &#34;for what I expected to be a peaceful old age&#34; and spent his time writing his memoirs and translating novels by Ram�n J. Sender. Then came the rebellion of 1936. While most other British residents fled to Gibraltar, Sir Peter was one of the few to stay in order to protect his house and garden, and his servants. Although an open sympathiser with the Anarchist cause, he provided a safe haven to the wife and five daughters of Tom�s Bol�n, members of a notorious right wing family, eventually helping them escape across the border. He later offered shelter to Arthur Koestler. When the Italian forces sent by Mussolini to support the rebellion took M�laga, they were both arrested by Tom�s Bol�n&#39;s nephew, Luis, who was Franco&#39;s chief propagandist and who had vowed that if he ever laid his hands on Koestler he would &#34;shoot him like a dog&#34;. This is his memoir of that period, first published in 1938.</p><p></p><h2>Bless Your Children Every Day</h2><p>This is a wonderful book versed with scripture references and is easy to understand. A great book to read to children.</p><p></p><h2>Choir Boy</h2><p>Twelve-year-old choirboy Berry wants nothing more than to remain a choirboy, surrounded by perfect notes, as opposed to his imperfect, quarreling parents. Choral music and the prospect of divinity thrill him. Desperate to keep his voice from changing, he tries to injure himself, and then convinces a clinic to give him testosterone-inhibiting drugs. The hormone pills keep Berry's voice from deepening but also cause him to grow breasts. Suddenly Berry faces a world of unexpected gender issues that push him into a universe far more complex than anything he has experienced. A fantastical coming-of-age story, <i>Choir Boy</i> combines off-kilter humor and its own brand of modern day magic in a rollicking, bittersweet story about growing up different.</p><p>A former choir boy, Charlie Anders still sings in choirs and karaoke bars. She's the publisher of other, the magazine of pop culture and politics for the new outcasts. Her writing has been published in the anthologies Pills Chills Thrills &amp; Heartache, It's All Good!, Pinned Down By Pronouns and The Anti-Capitalism Reader, and in Salon, the San Francisco Bay Guardian, Tikkun, Genre, and ZYZZYVA.She is the author of The Lazy Crossdresser (Greenery Press, 2002), a guide for anyone&#x2014;especially those born male&#x2014;who feels inadequate in women&#x2019;s clothing.Grade 10 Up&#x2013;Berry, 12, lives a lonely and disconnected life at home and finds his only moments of fulfillment and transcendence as a standout soloist in the choir. When he notices that puberty is beginning to crack the pristine pipes of other boys his age, he begins to fear his own transition to manhood. He decides that, in the tradition of the Castrati, he needs to terminate his impending flow of pitch-bending testosterone before it's too late. After an impulsive hack with a kitchen knife leaves his gonads smarting but intact, Berry is able to obtain a pharmaceutical solution: a mixture of testosterone inhibitors and female hormones meant for aspiring transsexuals. He has not yet begun to unravel the complex subtleties of his sexuality, nor does he fully fathom the side effects the regimen will produce. He soon finds himself with a pair of strapping breasts and is thus forced into some difficult life-altering decisions. The story features a cast of over-the-top characters and is delivered in a glib, hipsteresque narrative style reminiscent of Tom Robbins. While some readers may relish the underground tone, others will find it effete and annoying. The sometimes cartoonish treatment, while it does provide some mild comic enjoyment, ultimately subverts the emotional gravity of what are very weighty personal issues. That shortcoming, combined with the adult language and themes, makes this title unsuitable for most collections.<i>&#x2013;Jeffrey Hastings, Highlander Way Middle School, Howell, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With no resolution in sight, the colonial government declares war. One of the vessels requisitioned for the attack, the Hind, travels eastwards from Bengal to China, sailing into the midst of the First Opium War. The turbulent voyage brings together a diverse group of travellers, each with their own agenda to pursue. Among them is Kesri Singh, a sepoy in the East India Company who leads a company of Indian sepoys; Zachary Reid, an impoverished young sailor searching for his lost love, and Shireen Modi, a determined widow en route to China to reclaim her opium-trader husband&#x2019;s wealth and reputation. Flood of Fire follows a varied cast of characters from India to China, through the outbreak of the First Opium War and China&#x2019;s devastating defeat, to Britain&#x2019;s seizure of Hong Kong. Flood of Fire is a thrillingly realised and richly populated novel, imbued with a wealth of historical detail, suffused with the magic of place and plotted with verve.

Further, the novel provides highly dramatic depictions of key land and sea battles of the First Opium War. Beyond that, it presents a savvy account of the influence of the opium lobby on British foreign policy and the mental contortions of the "Apostles of Liberty" who identified the diabolical trade, so destructive of the people of both India and China, with freedom, commercial righteousness and religious enlightenment - all virtuously bestowed with guns and gunboats.&#x201d; &#x2015;Katherine A.

While it is no longer useful to think of a person&#x2019;s particular race, gender, sexual orientation, or choice as &#x201c;normal,&#x201d; the concept continues to haunt us in other ways. In <i>The End of Normal,</i> Lennard J. Davis explores changing perceptions of body and mind in social, cultural, and political life as the twenty-first century unfolds. The book&#x2019;s provocative essays mine the worlds of advertising, film, literature, and the visual arts as they consider issues of disability, depression, physician-assisted suicide, medical diagnosis, transgender, and other identities.</p> <p>Using contemporary discussions of biopower and biopolitics, Davis focuses on social and cultural production&#x2014;particularly on issues around the different body and mind. <i>The End of Normal</i> seeks an analysis that works comfortably in the intersection between science, medicine, technology, and culture, and will appeal to those interested in cultural studies, bodily practices, disability, science and medical studies, feminist materialism, psychiatry, and psychology.</p></p><p><p><b>Lennard J.

McLennan is a dynamic collection of provocative essays that critically challenge the design practices and thinking that are interwoven within our contemporary cultural, societal, and personal value systems.<p> Rather than an ominous commentary about the terminal shortcomings of society, McLennan relates his architectural acumen and his eclectic knowledge of sustainability, proposing an intelligent, and sometimes radical rethinking of how we live, work and plan for a living future.</p><p> McLennan addresses a wide variety of themes from personal to far-reaching systemic change. Each insight points the reader toward sustainable solutions, challenges the status quo, balances practicality with philosophy, and prepares us for a healthy and prosperous future. McLennan advocates for rapid social change calling for people to engage in productive initiatives beyond current models and to cooperate, take chances and experiment outside of current corporate imagination and our precarious societal scaffolding.</p><p> <i>Transformational Thought</i> provides us with compelling and timely direction in the most highly transformative era humanity is yet to face.</p></p><p>Considered one of the most influential individuals in the green building movement today, the work of Jason F. McLennan has made a strong impact on the shape and direction of green building in the United States and Canada and he is a much sought after presenter and consultant on a wide variety of green building and sustainability topics around the world.<p> McLennan serves as the CEO of the International Living Future Institute, a leading NGO that focuses on the transformation to a world that is socially just, culturally rich and ecologically restorative.

Fans raced to buy copies of their own, only to find out that the beautiful book didn't actually exist. However, since all of the letters referenced in the film did exist, we decided to publish this gorgeous keepsake ourselves. </p><p><i>Love Letters of Great Men</i> follows hot on the heels of the film and collects together some of history's most romantic letters from the private papers of Beethoven, Mark Twain, Mozart, and Lord Byron. For some of these great men, love is "a delicious poison" (William Congreve); for others, "a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, &amp; books &amp; music" (Charles Darwin). Love can scorch like the heat of the sun (Henry VIII), or penetrate the depths of one's heart like a cooling rain (Flaubert). Every shade of love is here, from the exquisite eloquence of Oscar Wilde and the simple devotion of Robert Browning, to the wonderfully modern misery of the Roman Pliny the Younger, losing himself in work to forget how much he misses his beloved wife, Calpurnia. </p><p>Taken together, these letters show that perhaps men haven't changed all that much over the last 2,000 years--passion, jealousy, hope and longing still rule their hearts and minds. In an age of e-mail and texted "i luv u"s, this timeless and unique collection reminds us that nothing can compare to the simple joy of sitting down to read a letter from the one you love.</p></p><p><p>Ursula Doyle lives in London where she was, until recently, the deputy publisher of Picador.</p>Inspired by the fictional book in the film SEX AND THE CITY, this is a collection of private letters from some of the most influential and prolific artists, statesmen, kings, and poets of Western history, from Pliny the Younger to Mozart to the letters sent by soldiers of war who never came home. Anton Lesser narrates with energy and sensitivity to the text, shifting his delivery to match the tone of each letter. In Daniel Webster&#39;s letter to his love, Josephine, in which he admonishes her forgotten bonnet for not giving up the secrets it must surely know, Lesser&#39;s narration is quick, coy, and engaging. In Oscar Wilde&#39;s letter to Lord Alfred Douglas during Wilde&#39;s trial for &#34;gross indecency,&#34; Lesser is dark, passionate, and deadly serious. A great collection with a great narrator.

Chesterton published this first collection of twelve short stories featuring Father Brown, a priest turned detective who combines philosophical and spiritual reasoning with scientific observation to solve crimes. In doing so, Chesterton laid the foundation for future detective figures in literature, such as Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Ellery Queen, and Nero Wolfe.<br> Unlike other writers of his time, who concocted outlandish crimes and intricate puzzles for the protagonist to solve, Chesterton pioneered the cozy mystery, narrowing the scope of the investigation to limited time, limited space, and a limited number of suspects, with all of the clues revealed to the reader as well as to the detective.<br> Chesterton is highly regarded as a biting social commentator, and his humorous and insightful comparisons leave readers reeling. The tales in this collection are short, easy reads with strong plots, all connected by the clever detective with an above-average understanding of human nature.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>8 1-hour cassettes<b>G. K. (Gilbert Keith) Chesterton</b> (1874&#x2013;1936) was an English writer, philosopher, satirist, and social critic. During his lifetime, the prolific Chesterton wrote eighty books, several hundred poems, some two hundred short stories, four thousand essays, and several plays. He was also known as a strong debater and Christian apologist. He often took on what he considered to be the flawed philosophy of modernism found in the writings of his good friends Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. It was Shaw who once referred to Chesterton in <i>Time</i> magazine as &#x201c;a man of colossal genius.&#x201d; Chesterton&#x2019;s writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humor. His ingenious use of paradox in his commentaries on the leading political, economic, philosophical, and theological beliefs makes his writings as relevant today as they were in his day.</p><h2>The Women of Deh Koh: Lives in an Iranian Village</h2><p>&#x201c;Masterful . . . absorbing. This finely written book gives us a whole new sense of Iran.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br> &nbsp;<br> While doing research in the Iranian village of Deh Koh, Erika Friedl was able to quietly observe and record the cloistered lives of women in one of the strictest of all Muslim societies. In this fascinating book, Friedl recounts these women&#x2019;s personal stories as they relate the strain of their daily activities, their intricate relationships with men, and their hopes, dreams, and fears. <i>Women of Deh Koh</i> is a rare and vivid look at what life is really like for the women of Iran. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Her intimate understanding of the life and customs of the village has made her confident about conveying her view from the inside. To share this view with us, and to comment quietly and wisely on the scene, is the striking and illuminating achievement of <i>Women of Deh Koh</i>.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>This book illuminates Iranian life with sympathy and understanding. It contains 12 chapters highlighting women's lives in an isolated Iranian village, less isolated today than a generation ago, but still dominated by tradition, religion, and a simplicity lost long ago in the city. The author, a trained anthropologist, skillfully portrays her heroines and their lives, characterized by major events such as motherhood, marriage, family crises, and constant struggle for livelihood in the sparse mountainous land. Her gentle and moving prose helps us understand a world different from our own, where religion and custom and family obligation have their own logic, infused with sorrow, but also joy and beauty. This should have some appeal. Recommended.<br><i>- Elizabeth R.

Again I lived through the events of 1887. Twenty-one months had passed since the Black Friday of November 11, when the Chicago men had suffered their martyrdom, yet every detail stood out clear before my vision and affected me as if it had happened but yesterday. My sister Helena and I had become interested in the fate of the men during the period of their trial. The reports in the Rochester newspapers irritated, confused, and upset us by their evident prejudice. The violence of the press, the bitter denunciation of the accused, the attacks on all foreigners, turned our sympathies to the Haymarket victims.&#x201d; &#x2013; Emma Goldman Although it&#x2019;s no longer well known as a flashpoint, few things were as controversial during the late 19th century as the Haymarket Affair. Depending on one&#x2019;s perspective, the riots and the violence that ensued were the result of anarchist terrorists attacking law enforcement authorities with a homemade bomb that was detonated during a large public event, killing a police officer and wounding several more. Others who were more sympathetic to the plight of the people protesting for better working conditions that night in Haymarket Square in Chicago on May 4, 1886 portray it as a peaceful rally that was marred by a heavy handed response attempting to disperse the protesters. What is clear is that the moments following the explosion were characterized by confusion and bedlam, as some people ran away and others ran toward the site. By the time the shooting was done, nearly a dozen lay dead, including a number of police officers, and makeshift hospitals were soon overwhelmed. Citizens in the area began to cry out for justice, and police detectives poured through the city, making arrests and questioning thousands. As word spread about the attack, cities around the country went on high alert, concerned that they could be next. It was soon determined that a traditionally anti-American group was responsible for the attack, and many threatened mob violence against anyone who looked like they might be involved with the group. The press egged on those in the public with cries for revenge and justice. Eventually, the suspected perpetrators&#x2019; trial began, a sensational event followed closely by many across the nation. Tensions ran high as those involved were prosecuted and defended, and when the jury convicted 8 anarchists of conspiracy and some of them were sentenced to death, many rejoiced while others cried out that Lady Justice had miscarried the case. Lost amidst the violence was the fact that the protests that culminated with the Haymarket Affair had come in response to previous labor strikes across the country, and controversial police shootings of some workers on strike, which took on a discriminatory undertone because many of the laborers were immigrants facing poor working conditions. It was against this backdrop that political anarchists also got involved, which muddled things and ultimately brought blowback against immigrant communities after the Haymarket Affair. More importantly, workers and those advocating on their behalf were galvanized by the events to push for what they considered much needed reforms, many of which would come over the next few decades. As professor William J. Adelman put it, "No single event has influenced the history of labor in Illinois, the United States, and even the world, more than the Chicago Haymarket Affair. It began with a rally on May 4, 1886, but the consequences are still being felt today.&#x201d; Chicago has since commemorated both the workers and the police with various memorials and plaques.</p><p></p><h2>Self-Enquiry (Vichara Sangraham) of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi (cover may vary)</h2><p>The <i>Vichara Sangraham</i> is the earliest recording of Maharshi's teachings.

What we observe with our senses is what is real. If it cannot be observed and measured, it does not exist. This is a sure comfortable world, the ability to observe and measure gives us certainty. With this certainty, we have in the last 200 years built an in�dustrial society with technologies based on measurable energies and devices controlled by tight all-embracing and not to be challenged physical &#34;laws.&#34; Except that we have a problem. These physical 3-space &#34;laws&#34; do not embrace or explain every observation. There are numerous exceptions, anomalies and inconsistencies to the laws. Moreover, our 3-space technology ignores even the possibility that there may exist forces and activities we cannot measure or observe. In brief, our reality is incomplete and if incomplete, our human laws are also incomplete. So we ask, is there another reality? Another dimension which originates these anomalies and inconsistencies that are not ex�plainable in 3-space terms? That our puzzling anomalies are actually the effects of an unseen causal source. This book explores technological anomalies to find they in�deed form a paradigm that cannot be explained in physical mate�rialist terms. This alternate paradigm cannot be explained with our 3-space terms, but has its own set of laws and conditions. This we call 4-space and the view from 4-space is awe-inspiring, to say the least. This paradigm has the seeds of, and is the basis of, future technology.</p><p></p><h2>The Labor of Faith: Gender and Power in Black Apostolic Pentecostalism</h2><p>In <i>The&nbsp;Labor of Faith</i> Judith Casselberry examines the material and spiritual labor of the women of the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, Inc., which is based in Harlem and one of the oldest and largest historically Black Pentecostal denominations in the United States. This male-headed church only functions through the work of the church's women, who, despite making up three-quarters of its adult membership, hold no formal positions of power. Casselberry shows how the women negotiate this contradiction by using their work to produce and claim a spiritual authority that provides them with a particular form of power. She also emphasizes how their work in the church is as significant, labor intensive, and critical to their personhood, family, and community as their careers, home and family work, and community service are. Focusing on the circumstances of producing a holy black female personhood, Casselberry reveals the ways twenty-first-century women's spiritual power operates and resonates with meaning in Pentecostal, female-majority, male-led churches.</p><p>Judith Casselberry is Associate Professor of Africana Studies at Bowdoin College. A vocalist and guitarist, Casselberry was a member of the award-winning reggae duo Casselberry-DuPre� and currently performs internationally with Toshi Reagon and BIGLovely."Anthropologist and Africana Studies scholar Judith Casselberry&#x2019;s <i>The Labor of Faith</i> is a rich interdisciplinary and ethnographic study that integrates spiritual, material, social, and structural spheres of twenty-first-century metropolitan New York Black Apostolic women&#x2019;s work. Casselberry highlights the role of Black women&#x2019;s religious labor in defining and sustaining personal faith, building churches and faith communities, and navigating intraracial and intergender power relations.

Ten years later he led his fellow prisoners on a protest against repressive conditions in Northern Ireland&#39;s H-Block prisons that grabbed the world&#39;s attention. After sixty-six days of refusing to eat, Sands died on May 5, 1981. Parliaments across the world stopped for a minute&#39;s silence in his honor. Bobby Sand&#39;s remarkable life and death have made him an Irish Che Guevara. Nothing But an Unfinished Song is the first biography to properly describe the motivation of the hunger strikers, recreating this period of history from within the prison walls. This powerful book illuminates for the first time this enigmatic, controversial and heroic figure.</p><p>Denis O&#39;Hearn has written for The Guardian, In These Times and many other publications. He is a professor sociology at the Universtiy of Binghamton in New York. He lives in Belfast with his partner and two daughters.The life of a truly remarkable young man: Bobby Sands ... how he grew from a plucky lad into a deeply committed, sensitive, anti-imperialist revolutionary, and how he, in turn, transformed the Nationalist Movement into a deeper, broader one. ... The life of Bobby Sands shows development, growth, maturation, and a profoundly humanistic internationalist flavor, in the midst of a bitter, ugly struggle that can purge the humanity out of anyone. The work also presents us with a picture not merely of the armed combatant, but of his love of music, and stories, and how he used these gifts to lift the spirits of his mates in the darkest of days. Nothing But An Unfinished Song is the story of how Irish nationalists battled British occupation, sectarian violence, and broken spirits. It has a message that will find interest everywhere. -- Mumia Abu-Jamal Denis O&#39;Hearn in his gripping, heart stopping, exhilarating sometimes sad book, Bobby Sands, tells an extraordinary story of life, love and noble death...A grand and inspiring book by a grand and inspiring writer. -- Malachy McCourt Bobby Sands, as this magnificent biography reminds us, was a hero for the whole world and yet broad Belfast to the core. We cried when he died, but he laughed in the face of tyranny and taught us the deepest meaning of comradeship. -- Mike Davis An excellent book. It tells not just the story of Bobby, the prison protest and hunger strikes but accurately captures the atmosphere of the prison.

In his effort to get at the presence lying beneath his elbow, Ponge charts out a space of silent consolation that lies beyond (and challenges) scientific objectivity and poetic transport. This is one of Ponge&#x2019;s most personal, overlooked, and&#x2015;because it was the project he was working on when he died&#x2015;his least processed works. It reveals the personal struggle Ponge engaged in throughout all of his writing, a hesitant uncertainty he usually pared away from his published texts that is at touching opposition to the manufactured, &#x201c;durable mother&#x201d; of the table on and of which he here writes.</p><p><b>Francis Ponge</b> (1899&#x2013;1988) was both a giant of French 20th-century poetry and one of its humblest practitioners. The poet of &#x201c;things,&#x201d; he practiced a poetic contemplation&#x2015;usually in the form of his own unique brand of hesitant, searching prose poem&#x2015;of the everyday objects that share our existence. He did not so much reinvent the shell, cigarette, soap, pebble, sun, oyster or asparagus, as forge and share with them a new language.The last of Ponge&#x2019;s published works, and the final volume to receive an English translation, <i>The Table</i> invariably carries the tone of an author returning to the very heart of his vocation through the things that make his utterances possible. It is his singular achievement to have submerged so fixedly into the world of everyday objects and coaxed from it a new cosmogony of language.

Willmott&#39;s three-volume history of the war in the Pacific, this work tells how Japan arrived at a situation in which war with the United States was the only means of ensuring long-term security and resolving her immediate problems of access to raw materials and of an unwinnable war in China. Totally balanced in presentation, the book also explains the basis of Allied miscalculations and provides explanations of the defeats that overwhelmed American, British, and Dutch forces throughout Southeast Asia in a little more than three months. Willmott argues that it was Japan&#39;s concentration and economy of force that contributed to its success in that early campaign. It was a later decision to disperse forces over a large area, he says, that resulted in Japan&#39;s loss of the Coral Sea and Midway battles and ultimately the entire war. The book&#39;s stunning assessment of those battles offers insights and interpretations that continue to be discussed, twenty-five years after it was first published.</p><p>H. P. Willmott, a member of the Royal Historical Society, has written more than a dozen books on modern naval and military subjects, including the final work in his trilogy, <i>Grave of a Dozen Schemes</i>, and the critically acclaimed history of the Second World War, <i>The Great Crusade</i>.

Focusing on New Mexico and Arizona, it also touches on neighboring states Texas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, and California, as well as northern Mexico. Lavender writes of the Southwest from the time of the earliest Indian inhabitants to the eras of the Spanish conquerors, the French fur trappers, and the eventual expansion of the United States into the area. He describes conflicts between Mexico and Spain, Mexico and Texas, and Mexico and the United States and explores the truth behind folklore and legends about cowboys, Indians, and outlaws. He also discusses the region's present-day problems--the difficulties of relationships among a variety of racial, cultural, and economic groups and the scarcity of usable land, water, and air. </p><br><p>"Delicious history, soundly investigated and superbly presented, enlivened by a sparkling style and rich in anecdotes and persona sketches. . . .

Paddle Pilgrim chronicles this &#x201c;adventure of a lifetime&#x201d; and recounts experiences from basking in a sublime sunset in Minnesota to dancing with a snake on an Arkansas sandbar. In addition to painting a kaleidoscope of vivid word pictures of river scenery, Ellingson writes movingly about the &#x201c;interior landscapes&#x201d; of solitude, silence, prayer, and communion with creation. &#x201c;What began as an adventure led to learning and ultimately to spiritual pilgrimage!&#x201d; he says. Ellingson teaches courses in spirituality, environmental ethics, human development, and youth ministry at Trinity Lutheran College in Everett, Wash. He is a Lutheran pastor, Master Gardener, former distance runner and triathlete, and father of five grown children. He resides in Edmonds, Wash.</p><p>Grandpa said &#x201c;You have ants in your pants!&#x201d; My mother described me as in &#x201c;perpetual motion&#x201d;. Teachers said I was hyperactive. They were all right. From the earliest age my middle name has been activity. This condition often gets me in trouble. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you just sit still?&#x201d; echoes from deep in my memory through many churches and classrooms. Finally a coach helped me to focus my energy and I was off and running, literally. But just running wasn&#x2019;t enough. The Forest Gump in me kept running and running and running. When I saw an American, Frank Shorter, win the Olympic marathon, I knew I had had to run that distance. Even after learning that the first runner, a Greek solder running from the Battle of Marathon to announce a victory, dropped dead, I wasn&#x2019;t deterred. I found out on those long lonely runs that it was about more than running. It was about self-discovery, prayer, adventure, communing with nature, and fulfilling my potential. This became the focus on my studies and led to a Doctorate in Holistic Health. Discovering I got stronger the longer the distance, I ran the 100 Mile Western States Endurance Run across the Sierra Nevada Mountains and topped that mountaintop experience by completing the Iron Man Triathlon in Hawaii. All of this activity, however, came with a steep price. Over a 30 year period I wore out my knees and had to have each replaced. I don&#x2019;t run and run and run anymore, but I still need to move and to be active. Living near the water (rivers/lakes/oceans) much of my life I have felt a deep connection with my &#x201c;water-spirit&#x201d;. I knew as soon as I paddled my first kayak that I had found a wonderful new way to explore both exterior and interior landscapes. The seed of the idea to paddle the Mississippi River was planted when I read two books as a boy. Minn of the Mississippi, by H.C. Holling, tells the story of a turtle&#x2019;s journey down the river and Mark Twain&#x2019;s Huck Finn, shares the tale of two very different people&#x2019;s lives woven together as their raft floats downstream. I honestly didn&#x2019;t know if I could paddle the entire river, but I knew that I had to begin. Once that happened there was no stopping me. And with it came the ultimate irony that I was sitting but not still! And that surprised even me!<p>The reader is blessed to have the opportunity to join Dave in the cockpit of his kayak for the ride of a lifetime.<br>&#x2013; Jim Lewis, author and adventurer</p> <p>Through his writing, often humorous musings and keen observations, Dave brings the river and its colorful inhabitants to life.

Good to have you back!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good to be back, Sergeant Hollice.&#x201d; Torin thumbprinted the release that would send her gear straight to her quarters and fell into step beside the sergeant as they crossed the shuttle bay. &#x201c;And congratulations on the promotion.&#x201d; Adrian Hollice had been in her squad when she was a sergeant and then, when she made staff sergeant, her platoon. She&#x2019;d fast-tracked him onto his SLC and had been pleased to see her decision justified when Command had given him his third hook. Not that she needed reassurance that she&#x2019;d been right&#x2014;these days, she needed reassurance that Command didn&#x2019;t have its head so far up its collective ass it was cutting off all oxygen to its collective brain. &#x201c;The squad have any trouble getting used to it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not after Ressk and Mashona knocked a couple of heads together. They said I&#x2019;d been leading them around by thediran avirrk for months anyway, I might as well get paid for it.&#x201d;</p><p>Torin grinned. The Corps tried to keep combat units together when it could. Familiar faces strengthened both stability and loyalty under adverse conditions, and Marines had their own ways of working through the disruptions promotions brought.</p><p>&#x201c;The captain was a little afraid they were going to send you to Recar&#x2019;ta HQ,&#x201d; Hollice told her as they stepped onto the lower beltway.</p><p>&#x201c;So was I.&#x201d; After Crucible, after she&#x2019;d been detanked with her jaw rebuilt, after she&#x2019;d passed the physical and psych evaluations that followed any major reconstruction, Torin had asked to be returned to Sh&#x2019;quo Company. They were short NCOs and, as she&#x2019;d pointed out, she&#x2019;d be wasted in a staff position. Although the Corps reserved the right to send her wherever the hell it pleased, both points were inarguable and she&#x2019;d been sent home. It hadn&#x2019;t hurt that the Commandant of the Corps had agreed with her&#x2014;although wasted in a staff position had not been the phrase used.</p><p>&#x201c;The last thing we need around here is someone else who thinks she&#x2019;s always right,&#x201d; had been the gist of the Commandant&#x2019;s observations.</p><p>Given the hour, the lower beltway was nearly deserted.</p><p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve started sweeping our Division.&#x201d; Hollice stood self-consciously erect as they rode toward the heart of the station. &#x201c;Started at First Recar&#x2019;ta, of course, so the war could bloody well be over before they get to us at Fourth. Scuttlebutt says they haven&#x2019;t found anything yet.&#x201d;</p><p>He tugged at his collar tabs, and Torin hid a smile at the telltale sign. In a poker game, he&#x2019;d have been bluffing. In a conversation, he was trying to draw her out. This was why he&#x2019;d come to meet her; she&#x2019;d been with the recon team on Big Yellow&#x2014;the alien spaceship that had turned out to be the actual alien, or aliens, the terminology remained uncertain&#x2014;later, she&#x2019;d initiated the investigation into why nobody remembered Big Yellow&#x2019;s missing escape pod and had most recently spoken to a collective of the alien on Crucible. Granted, melting her jaw during a last-ditch attempt to override a reprogrammed OpSat had meant she&#x2019;d been tanked during the initial There are aliens among us!hysteria, and she&#x2019;d missed the development of the search protocols, but she was the closest thing to an authority in the Sector.</p><p>&#x201c;You think they will, Gunny?&#x201d; Hollice prodded. &#x201c;Find anything, I mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Find bits of a polynumerous shape-shifting, organic plastic alien that boots through our security protocols like cheddar through a H&#x2019;san?&#x201d; Torin asked him blandly. &#x201c;One that can separate into submicroscopic pieces to avoid detection and then recombine itself back to sentience when the danger has passed? I very much doubt it.&#x201d; Search protocols and calming announcements from the Elder Races be damned. &#x201c;Not unless it wants to be found.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;</p><p>She had to admire the dryness of his delivery. He&#x2019;d deserved that promotion. &#x201c;Not really.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What does it want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It told me it was collecting data.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Studying us?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So it seems.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No idea. We may never know.&#x201d; Little pieces of plastic were ubiquitous throughout Confederation space. The alien could be a part of any of them. It could be any of them. It could mimic other materials, and while the parts they&#x2019;d most recently been in contact with had been gray, Big Yellow proved rather conclusively that didn&#x2019;t have to be the case. The handrail on the beltway could be recording data for the alien&#x2014;as the alien&#x2014;while she passed. Torin, by career choice and disposition more paranoid than most, had made a conscious decision not to think about that.</p><p>&#x201c;It could make us all forget it was ever here,&#x201d; Hollice pointed out, his voice fraying a bit around the edges.</p><p>&#x201c;Not all of us, Hollice.&#x201d;</p><p>He turned, stared at her for a moment, and smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. It can&#x2019;t mess with your head.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Took a look inside and was scared off. It wants to get to Sh&#x2019;quo Company, it&#x2019;ll have to get through me.&#x201d; Which was both the truth and complete bullshit since she had no more way of stopping the alien, singly or collectively, than she had of convincing the Navy that a straight line was the shortest distance between two points. But it was bullshit Hollice needed to hear and bullshit he needed to repeat to his squad. Or maybe it was the part of the statement that was the truth he needed to repeat. Whatever worked.</p><p>Technically, it hadn&#x2019;t messed with her head. Hadn&#x2019;t adjusted her memories of the escape pod the way it had adjusted the memories of nearly everyone else who&#x2019;d been involved in the exploration of Big Yellow.</p><p>Hadn&#x2019;t and couldn&#x2019;t were two totally different things.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The shortage of NCOs meant that Torin had only to put in a request to the station sysop to have her old quarters reassigned. The recon mission to Big Yellow had been a temporary posting, but the promotion before traveling to Ventris to brief Command on the Silsviss had destroyed the certainty of a round-trip ticket&#x2014;integrating an aggressive reptilian species into the Corps would take decades, and she&#x2019;d essentially been responsible for their willingness to join. That made her, if not an expert on the species, someone whose opinion Command intended to exploit. Fortunately, new information from the Marines stationed at the embassy on Silsviss had pushed her experience out toward the edge of the target. Some of those Marines were trained xenopsychologists rather than a noncom with good instincts and a willingness to kick ass when required, and, more importantly, none of them had been expected to kill a senior officer.</p><p>Torin suspected a few people were concerned because they still weren&#x2019;t sure if she&#x2019;d have gone through with it had General Morris&#x2019; sacrifice actually been necessary. She supposed it didn&#x2019;t help that when asked directly she&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;As it wasn&#x2019;t necessary, I guess we&#x2019;ll never know.&#x201d;</p><p>Which was the absolute truth; it wasn&#x2019;t something anyone could know until it happened&#x2014;no matter what they believed themselves capable of.</p><p>Her willingness to hack Major Svensson&#x2019;s arm off with an ax hadn&#x2019;t reassured anyone.</p><p>When she dialed the door open, her quarters looked just as she remembered them, right down to the Silsviss skull hanging on the wall over her entertainment unit. Weird. When she&#x2019;d left for Ventris, she&#x2019;d put everything she wasn&#x2019;t taking with her into station storage.</p><p>&#x201c;Messages?&#x201d; she asked as the door slid shut behind her.</p><p>She&#x2019;d verbalized, so the station did the same. &#x201c;One message to Gunnery Sergeant Kerr from Staff Sergeant Greg Reghubir. As follows: &#x201c;Welcome back, Gunny. We figured the last thing you&#x2019;d need to do was sort your crap out, so we did it for you. Lance Corporal Ressk says you need stronger encryptions on your storage unit.&#x201d; Greg sounded matter-of-fact, but Torin would have bet hard currency that he&#x2019;d changed his own unit&#x2019;s setting immediately after he saw what Ressk could do with an eight-digit code. &#x201c;Twenty-thirty tonight in the SRM; don&#x2019;t be late, or we&#x2019;ll start without you.&#x201d;</p><p>Torin patted the skull fondly as she passed on her way to the shower. It was good to be home.</p><p>* * *</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a lot of action out on the edge of the sector. Long-range sensors have picked up Susumi portals here, here, and here.&#x201d; Captain Rose touched three points on the star field currently mapped out on the briefing room&#x2019;s HMU and frowned at the resulting red lights. &#x201c;Navy swears they&#x2019;re not responsible.&#x201d;</p><p>Second Lieutenant Jarret&#x2019;s lavender eyes darkened as light receptors opened to give him a better look at the map. &#x201c;Civilians, sir?&#x201d;</p><p>The captain sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always possible some dumbass corporation or university has decided to scout the perimeter&#x2014;those types always think they&#x2019;re invincible until they find out they aren&#x2019;t and we have to pull their butts out of the fire&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t honestly think so. We usually get some kind of a heads up just so we&#x2019;re available to pull those butts out of the fire, and, so far, no one&#x2019;s admitting they&#x2019;ve gone visiting.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about independents, sir?&#x201d; Second Lieutenant Heerik was brand new, on her first posting with none of her enthusiasm blunted, and more than one of Sh&#x2019;quo Company&#x2019;s officers and NCOs bent over their slates and hid a smile at the intensity of the Krai lieutenant&#x2019;s question.</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of independents did you have in mind, Lieutenant?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, maybe civilian salvage operators.&#x201d; Her nose ridges flared. &#x201c;It was a CSO who found Big Yellow.&#x201d;</p><p>And Torin felt the attention of the room shift to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunnery Sergeant Kerr?&#x201d;</p><p>Torin had served with the captain long enough to know he was amused her relationship&#x2014;or whatever the hell it was she had with Craig Ryder&#x2014;had made it into the briefing. Although his reaction was subtle enough, the odds were good no one else could see it. &#x201c;CSO Craig Ryder found Big Yellow because of a small error in his Susumi calculations.&#x201d; She waited out the murmur of reaction. Small errors in Susumi calculations were usually fatal errors. &#x201c;Spaced as they are. . .&#x201d; She nodded toward the lights on the map. &#x201c;. . . these portals are clearly deliberate. Salvage operators follow rather than lead, and there&#x2019;s nothing happening out there. No debris, no reason for them to be deliberately jumping that way.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Unless there&#x2019;s something happening out there,&#x201d; Lieutenant Jarret said thoughtfully.</p><p>&#x201c;Unless,&#x201d; Captain Rose agreed. &#x201c;Which is why the Navy has sent the Hardyr out to have a look around. Captain Treis came out of Susumi space here. . .&#x201d; Another touch on the star map illuminated a fourth portal, this one green. &#x201c;. . . and is proceeding with due caution to this system, ST7/45T2. . .&#x201d; One last touch. &#x201c;. . . here.&#x201d; The system was equidistant from all three red portals.</p><p>&#x201c;How long is due caution expected to take, sir?&#x201d; Lieutenant Joriyl wondered.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll likely be headed Coreward before it happens, Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>Her pale orange eyes darkened as she smiled. &#x201c;And not a moment too soon, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Lieutenant di&#x2019;Pin Joriyl was the senior platoon officer. With her heading into Ventris on course that meant. . .</p><p>Torin blinked as she realized that meant Second Lieutenant di&#x2019;Ka Jarret would be senior. The voice of reason and experience for Second Lieutenant Heerik and an even greener second lieutenant to be named later. It hadn&#x2019;t been quite a year since a very green Jarret had been tossed into a stew of giant lizards and diplomacy gone bugfuk, and suddenly Torin felt old. Life was moving just a little too fast of late.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Treis will keep Recar&#x2019;ta Station informed, Recar&#x2019;ta will keep Battalion informed, and&#x2014;if we&#x2019;re really lucky&#x2014;Battalion will let us know what the hell is going on before they ship us out to deal with it. Platoons are nearly at full strength for the first time in a long time, so let&#x2019;s make sure everyone&#x2019;s geared up and ready to go.&#x201d; The star field flicked off. Captain Rose swept his gaze around the room, then nodded once. &#x201c;Details have been downloaded to your slates; get out there and get ready to save the galaxy&#x2019;s ass yet again. Gunnery Sergeant Kerr, remain behind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Torin stood as the officers and NCOs made their way out of the small briefing room, Jarret throwing her a distinct we&#x2019;ll get together later before turning his attention back to Heerik, who continued talking about the best responses to possible foothold situations, unaware of expressions exchanged nearly a meter over her head. Torin had been Jarret&#x2019;s staff sergeant for that snafu of a giant lizard diplomacy trip, and she&#x2019;d been impressed by the way the young officer had handled himself&#x2014;both independently and under her guidance. If he stayed beyond his first contract, he&#x2019;d be a credit to the Corps, and she&#x2019;d be happy to serve under him again.</p><p>When the room emptied, she followed Captain Rose and First Sergeant Siaosi Tutone through the door to the captain&#x2019;s office.</p><p>&#x201c;Opinion, Gunny?&#x201d; he asked, dropping into the chair behind his desk. Captain Rose&#x2019;s voice had always seemed about three sizes too big for his body, but here, in the relative privacy of his office, he sounded tired. No, weary. Tired of all the crap that came from being a fair distance down the military food chain.</p><p>Or maybe Torin was reading too much into it.</p><p>&#x201c;I think three Susumi points definitely indicates the Others are interested in something in that end of the Sector,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;I think the lack of any significant attempt to hide their presence means they&#x2019;re coming through in force. I think the Navy should have sent more ships because if the Others get that force on the ground we&#x2019;re looking at Battalion moving the whole Ground Combat Team out in response. And I think that the music selection in the Senior Ranks&#x2019; Mess changed for the worse while I was gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be my selection,&#x201d; the first sergeant pointed out. His voice was as deep as the captain&#x2019;s although less incongruous, rumbling up as it did from the depth of an enormous barrel chest. Torin was tall, but Tutone topped her by a head and a half&#x2014;taller even than most di&#x2019;Taykan&#x2014;and proportionately broad. His hands were enormous, and muscle strained against the confines of his Class Cs.</p><p>&#x201c;Good choice, First. It&#x2019;s past time I broadened my musical tastes,&#x201d; Torin added, although she wasn&#x2019;t sure whether she was aiming for more or for less sincerity.</p><p>Tutone grinned, teeth flashing white against the rich mahogany of his skin.</p><p>Captain Rose leaned back in his chair and smiled as well. &#x201c;Welcome home, Gunny. It&#x2019;s good to have you back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, sir. It&#x2019;s good to be back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Recar&#x2019;ta Station agrees with your analysis, by the way. When the orders come down, they&#x2019;ll come down for the entire GCT. That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here, specifically here with Sh&#x2019;quo Company when we don&#x2019;t generally rate a gunny. Aman&#x2019;s short, and she&#x2019;s not reupping. Unless we deploy in the next tenday, that&#x2019;ll leave Jura&#x2019;s platoon with a shiny new second lieutenant and Heerik, who&#x2019;s almost as shiny, with a green staff sergeant. We&#x2019;ll move the new staff sergeant in under Jarret, since he&#x2019;s got a whole year of experience. . .&#x201d; Pale eyes rolled, although for the most part he kept the sarcasm from his voice. &#x201c;. . . but that&#x2019;s going to leave the company scrambling for experience among the officers and senior NCOs.

The world went from a thousand to a billion postcards in a very short span of time, with the finest painters from India, Austria and Japan getting involved.<br>Paper Jewels is the story of postcards during the Raj, and covers India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Burma. It is the first book on the subject and features hundreds of professionally-restored images in original format, weaving together the postcard artists, photographers, and publishers who define the rich history of the medium. The author's research also charts the history and progression of the technological aspects of postcard publishing and its key players. The concluding chapters explore the role postcards played in the Independence struggle, from the First Non-Cooperation Movement through the Dandi March and Partition. It includes some of the earliest cards of Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammed Ali Jinnah and other political figures. Many of the images in the book have not been seen since they were first published nearly a century ago. <br>Published in association with The Alkazi Collection of Photography.</p><p>The author, Omar Khan, has researched early photography and ephemera of the subcontinent for thirty years and acquired a large collection of the early postcards featured here.

The youngest daughter, Kieks, joined the Resistance, delivering illegal newspapers, guiding British parachutists around The Hague and preparing safe houses for members of the Special Forces who were dropped in from England. As the War continued, she fell in love with a Resistance commander, and worked with him to rescue wounded colleagues, steal weapons from German arms dumps and move weapons around the country. They had a tumultuous parting and she continued her work, acting as a courier with a two hundred km bike ride to the north of Holland. When she returned home, she appreciated how much the war had changed her and her boyfriend, and prepared to try a reconciliation. She escaped a firing squad four times, and survived the war, mentally scarred by her experiences. She sought help, but the help she was offered came in a poisoned chalice, and she kept her secret to herself for almost fifty years. Her family in Holland was recognised by Yad Vashem, the Israeli organisation that records those who saved Jews from the Holocaust, and she was awarded a pension for her work in the Resistance by the Dutch foundation Stichting 1940-1945. It was only when these organisations acknowledged the truth of her claims that she had the confidence to tell her family of the events from long ago.</p><p>The author, Andrew, had only a vague inkling of the role his mother played during World War II, until 1992 when she visited him in Washington for a short holiday. Her family had been recognised by the Jewish organisation Yad Vashem for saving the lives of Jews, and she had been awarded a pension for her work in the Dutch Resistance. She started talking, and vivid fragments of stories started tumbling out. They were confused, fragmented and disjointed, and Andrew started writing notes, trying to piece together the whole story. As he refined the story, more fragments came to light and the story evolved into this book. Tensions in the house where the Jews were hidden, evading a search by the Gestapo, romance in the tulip fields, and a fiery parting. Almost seventy years after the war, fragments continued to come out, and on her 90th birthday the story caught the attention of a local newspaper which published details, leading to further stories in the Scottish press. This was picked up by a dutchman, whose wife was the granddaughter of her former boyfriend. He wrote to the author, confirming more of the story and providing further fragments of the story. Andrew continues to work as a research scientist in a local technology company, and spends his spare time at the local rowing club.</p><h2>Celestial Navigation for Yachtsmen</h2><p><p>There is deep mystery and profound satisfaction in finding your position on earth by reference to the sun, moon, and stars--not to mention profound relief when the GPS receiver stops working in mid-passage.

The road follows the Mediterranean coast for about seventeen hundred miles. Almost every inch of it is brown twelve months a year-rock and sand baking in the sun. Then you cross an invisible line at the edge of the Nile Valley. Everywhere is an eruption of green. Not even the congestion of Cairo can contain the riot of vegetation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For millennia, no other territory in the Middle East produced such a bounty. Where the yearly flooding of the Euphrates was violent and destructive, the cycles of the Nile were gentle and predictable. A truism holds that the histories of Egypt and Iraq follow their rivers. Medieval sultans dug a well, known today as the Nile-o-meter, on Rawda Island in Cairo, to measure the water level. The annual rise determined how generous the crops would be that year, and the sultans taxed the peasants accordingly. Farming was that easy. The Nile Valley became the breadbasket of the Arab world. Egyptians swelled with pride in their river. Whoever drinks the water of the Nile will return again to Egypt, the old saying goes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Egyptians also like to say that they have been rallying around grand national projects since the Pharaohs built the temples of Thebes. After taking power in 1952, President Gamal Abdel Nasser decided to build a great dam at Aswan, near the Sudanese border, to harness the Nile for hydroelectric power. Abdel Nasser promised a dam "more magnificent and seventeen times greater than the Pyramids."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced in 1955 that the United States and the United Kingdom would provide $70 million in assistance for construction of the dam. But he did not like Abdel Nasser's denunciations of colonialism, or his refusal to ally exclusively with Washington. After seven months, Dulles withdrew the offer. Abdel Nasser turned to Moscow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dam became a monument to Stalinist engineering. Its construction displaced one hundred twenty thousand Nubians, the dark-skinned Egyptians indigenous to the area. The lake formed by the dam nearly demolished the breathtaking Pharaonic temples at Abu Simbel; UNESCO saved them by paying Western European contractors to relocate the complex, stone by stone, on drier ground. The finished dam stopped the flow of silt and nutrients that had kept much of the Nile Valley so fertile for centuries. The depletion of the water devastated the farmlands downstream and the fishing around the mouth of the Nile. The slowing of the current led to an explosion in waterborne diseases like schistosomiasis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To fight the disease, Abdel Nasser's successors launched a massive campaign of inoculations. But government health workers reused unsterilized needles. That set off a hepatitis C epidemic that raged on for decades. About one in five Egyptians was infected with "virus C," as Egyptians called it, in imported English. Barbers spread the disease by reusing blades, so sensible Egyptian men carried their own personal shears to haircuts, and I did as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The adage about drinking the Nile water lives on today as black humor. The river is so filthy that your first stop would be a hospital. Yet Egyptian schoolchildren are still taught to celebrate Abdel Nasser's High Dam as an unalloyed triumph. I think of the dam whenever I get a haircut: a parable of centralized planning and unaccountable power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had the luck to be an American journalist living in Cairo during the thirty months when Egyptians broke free of the autocracy that ruled them. Their escape set off revolts from Benghazi to Baghdad. But the old authoritarian order had only hidden underground, not shattered. It returned to take revenge. A reinvigorated autocracy did its best to blot out the memory of those thirty months of freedom. Let me tell you the story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>City of Contradictions</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>August 14, 2010-January 1, 2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My introduction to Egypt was an iftar-the ritual meal at dusk to break the Ramadan fast-on a gritty day in August 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My family and I had moved that week into a one-story villa in Maadi, a leafy district about six miles up the Nile from the New York Times bureau on the island of Zamalek. Both neighborhoods-Maadi and Zamalek-are full of Western expats and Egyptian old money. I had a twenty-minute drive to work if the streets were empty. Usually the lawless traffic made the trip more than an hour. Mercedes sedans and Land Rovers veered around donkey carts stacked with carrots or garlic. Families of four or five crammed onto the backs of Korean motorcycles, and mothers rode sidesaddle with infants in their arms. My wife, Laura, and I had hauled our one-year-old's car seat all the way from Washington. We felt so fussy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was drawn to Egypt in part by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. I knew the roots of Al Qaeda and its ideology ran back to Egypt. Also, I had turned forty in 2010. I wanted a change from Washington, where I had reported for the previous six years. That was about the extent of my preparation for my posting in Cairo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was thrilled with the job. Egypt, home to a quarter of all Arabs, had set every major trend in religion, culture, and politics across the Arab world for more than half a century. Egypt commanded the largest Arab army and held together the region. It kept the peace with Israel. After Israel, Cairo had received more United States aid over the decades than any other country-over $70 billion, at a rate of $1.5 billion a year at the time I arrived. Whatever happened in Egypt was in a way an American story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The skinny apparatchik in charge of the international news media had welcomed me to Egypt just a few days earlier. He told me that the Foreign Ministry had recalled him from the San Francisco consulate to apply his public relations expertise to the upcoming reelection of President Hosni Mubarak, who was then eighty-two and seeking his seventh five-year term in office. But the genial bureaucrat, Attiya Shakran, talked mostly about how sorry he was to leave San Francisco. Expect laziness and dysfunction from Egyptians, he told me. IBM in Egypt stood for Inshallah, Bokra, Malesh-God willing, tomorrow, sorry!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About three dozen people had gathered for the iftar in a private dining room high in the Sofitel hotel on the tip of Zamalek, with a sweeping view of the river. U.S. ambassador Margaret Scobey opened the event by recalling the iftar President Thomas Jefferson had hosted at the White House. She reprised the main themes that President Barack Obama had laid out in a speech in Cairo the previous year, about "a new beginning" for American relations with the Muslim world. But she left out the indelicate parts, like Obama's Quranic admonition to "speak always the truth," or his nod to the universal right "to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My table felt like a scene in a World War I movie where warring generals meet for tea during a break in the battle. The embassy had invited some of Egypt's most notable dissidents and they were seated with me. One was a shaggy-haired, foul-mouthed blogger known for publicizing videos of police abuse and sexual harassment; the security services had recently shut down his website. Another was an Egyptian political scientist at the American University in Cairo who specialized in the defects of Arab authoritarianism. And a third was a researcher for Human Rights Watch. Mubarak kept the organization in a legal limbo, refusing to either fulfill or reject its license application, which meant that at any moment his police could jail its researcher, Heba Morayef.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side of the table were American diplomats and Mubarak officials, all chatting amiably with the dissenters and me. Was I familiar with the figs and soup traditionally served first after a day of fasting, to reawaken digestion? Had I tried kushari, the beloved staple of Egyptian cuisine? (Rice and pasta mixed with lentils and garbanzo beans, flavored by three different sauces at once-vinegar and garlic, tomato, and hot pepper.) Or how about roasted pigeon? It was a delicacy here. We made small talk about politics in Washington and Cairo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So many contradictions hung out in the open in the late summer of 2010. Facebook pages borrowed Silicon Valley marketing techniques to agitate against Mubarak and attracted an audience running into tens of thousands. A left-leaning activist group calling themselves the April 6 Youth Movement, after the date of a wildcat strike at a textile plant, claimed more than seventy thousand online members. But a newspaper columnist who questioned the president's health was sentenced to jail for destabilizing the country. Membership in the Muslim Brotherhood was illegal, but eighty-eight of its members served openly in Parliament. They made up 20 percent of the otherwise docile chamber and constituted Mubarak's only real opposition. Egyptian papers covered the sayings and doings of the Brotherhood's "general guide," a sixty-eight-year-old veterinarian, in the same way the New York tabloids might cover the city's Catholic archbishop (or, for that matter, the way the Egyptian papers covered the pope of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church, whose members made up about 10 or 15 percent of the population).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conservatives in the Brotherhood's leadership-including an obscure engineering professor from the Nile Delta named Mohamed Morsi-had recently forced off its governing board their movement's most charismatic moderate, a physician named Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh. But in the summer of 2010 the Brotherhood was collecting signatures for the presidential candidacy of Mohamed ElBaradei, the Noble Prize-winning diplomat who had become the Arab world's best-known liberal. Strange bedfellows. Of course, Mubarak would never allow ElBaradei to run. The state newspapers were busily besmirching him with bogus reports that he had abetted the American invasion of Iraq. One paper published pictures of ElBaradei's daughter in a bikini-a shocking indecency to most Egyptians. ElBaradei's aides found audio surveillance bugs in his office that summer, and the government made almost no attempt to deny or censor reports that intelligence agencies-the mukhabarat-were behind it. I was the only one surprised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one saw any chance that the character of the regime might change any time soon. That is why government officials and prominent dissidents could dine together so comfortably. Yet the daily dysfunction of the state boggled my mind. Fiefdoms within the government bureaucracy sparred publicly with one another. Judges protested that the police threatened their independence. Diplomats rolled their eyes at their geriatric president. And the military and interior ministries more or less openly competed with one another for influence and power. In 1986, several thousand police conscripts had staged an armed insurrection. Army troops fought them with gunfire in city streets and hotel lobbies. Now the gossip buzzing around the embassy iftar was about how much animosity the military commanders felt toward the president's son and heir apparent, forty-six-year-old Gamal Mubarak. He stood to become the first Egyptian head of state from outside the military in fifty-eight years, since Abdel Nasser's Free Officers overthrew the British-backed monarchy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gamal-or Jimmy, as hip Egyptians called him-had gotten rich as an investment banker in London and Cairo. Then his father installed him atop the ruling party and began grooming him for high office. Everybody was doing it. Hafez al-Assad had bequeathed power over Syria to his son. His fellow dictators in Tunisia and Libya were in the process of passing on their jobs to members of their families. Plenty of Arab states were straight-up hereditary monarchies (Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and four of its Persian Gulf neighbors). So why not Gamal? He was pitching himself as the leader for a new generation: the three out of four Egyptians under forty, and the two out of three under thirty-five.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was seated next to a close friend of Gamal's, Tamim Khallaf. He was a diplomat who had gone to college with the researcher for Human Rights Watch. Now he had been seconded by his ministry to help tutor Gamal. Khallaf told me that he had watched the 2008 American presidential election from a fellowship at Harvard, and when he learned I had covered the race he was full of questions. What had happened to Hillary Clinton? Had Sarah Palin hurt John McCain?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had a question for him, too. Would his friend Gamal really run for president to succeed his father in 2011? Khallaf practically winked at me. The Mubaraks were treating the presidential palace as a personal plantation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would later learn that the chief of military intelligence, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was in the midst of tackling the same question. Intelligence in the Arab world sometimes includes spying on a head of state himself, and Sisi had reported to the top generals that summer that the president might hand his office to his son as soon as the elder Mubarak's eighty-third birthday, in May 2011. Sisi predicted to the generals that Egyptians would rise up in revolt. Mubarak would respond by ordering the army to quell the unrest. Then the generals would face some decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The army had crushed bread riots under President Anwar Sadat in 1977 and the police mutiny under Mubarak in 1986. But the military was a barony of its own. It held the heavy weapons, and its obedience to any civilian was still a matter of choice. Would the generals answer the president's call?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As recently as January 2010, at a ceremony for his promotion to chief of military intelligence, Sisi had publicly praised Mubarak as a father to his country. "Egypt's flag will always continue to fly high under his leadership," Sisi had said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He recommended to the generals just a few months later that they reject Mubarak. Sisi told the generals to declare loyalty to the people, not the president. They should shape their own transition. A modern state might call that treason. But the time was still ripening as we gathered that summer at the iftar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had skipped lunch. As soon as the sun went down I dived into the hummus, grape leaves, lamb, couscous, and anything else I could reach. The Muslims around me only picked at the food. They were pacing themselves, they told me, for a long night of festive eating. They had just woken up, and they would nap the next day. Night is day and day is night during Ramadan in Cairo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the middle of the twentieth century, Egypt had led the Arab world to independence from the former colonial powers. It became the wellspring of Arab nationalism, political Islam, and global jihad. Everything in the Arab world had seemed to start in Cairo. Anyone in the region who cared about local politics also followed politics in Cairo. The vibrancy, nightlife, and climate lured the princes of the oil-rich Gulf to holiday at the beaches of Sharm el-Sheikh or the Marriott in Zamalek. The people of neighboring basket cases like Yemen, Jordan, Libya, or the Palestinian territories looked to Egypt as a big brother. Cairo was the place for education and culture, the big time.</p></p><h2>Feminism and Religion</h2><p>Rita M. Gross offers an engaging survey of the changes feminism has wrought in religious ideas, beliefs, and practices around the world, as well as in the study and understanding of religion itself.</p><p>How has feminism changed the world&#39;s religions and the way we study them? Feminism and Religion provides a comprehensive--at times provocative--answer to this important question. Distinguished religion scholar Rita Gross explores how the feminist social vision transformed religious thought, ritual, leadership, and institutions around the world, from Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism to new religious movements like feminist spirituality.Rita M. Gross is professor of philosophy and religious studies at the University of Wisconsin &#x2013; Eau Claire. She is the author of <i>Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism</i> and coeditor, with Nancy Auer Falk of <i>Unspoken Worlds: Women's Religious Lives.</i></p><h2>Portuguese Commandos: Feared Insurgent Hunters, 1961-1974 (Africa@War)</h2><p>During the 13-year insurgency (1961&#x2013;74) in Portuguese Africa, more than 800,000 men and women served in the Portuguese armed forces. Of this number, about 9,000 served as commandos (or about 1 percent). Yet their combat losses &#x2015; 357 dead, 28 missing in action and 771 wounded &#x2015; represented 11.5 percent of the total casualties (a percentage 10 times that of normal troops). It is well established that these warriors were responsible for the elimination of more insurgents and capturing more of their weapons than any other force during the war. Great pains were taken to stay abreast of the latest enemy operational methods and maintain the 'warrior edge' in the force. This edge, in essence, was an approach to fighting that pushed the commandos always to think of themselves as the hunter rather than the hunted. Officers returning from contact with the enemy were rigorously debriefed, and commando instructors regularly participated in operations to learn of the latest enemy developments. This information was integrated with intelligence from other sources gathered by the military and national intelligence services, and from this current knowledge, training was constantly revised to remain attuned to the enemy and his behavior. The commandos became a breed apart - and their reputation was such that when insurgents discovered a unit deployed into their area, they would generally withdraw until the killers left. This commando training - and its sympathy with the fighting environment - made the commandos the most effective ground force in the Portuguese Army. The commandos were expert practitioners in the art of counterinsurgency, and their practice of destroying the enemy in great numbers quickly and quietly served as inspiration not only to South Africa and Rhodesia, but to the enemy himself. This is the story of the Portuguese commandos: their beginnings, their unique operations and their legacy and influence in subsequent sister units such as the Buffalo Battalion of South Africa.</p><p>John P.

He was the World Champion for three years, after winning the title by beating Tigran Petrosian. His name is forever linked with his great rival Bobby Fischer and their epic 1972 &#x2018;Match of the Century', which did so much to popularize the game throughout the world. Over the board, Spassky is renowned for his universal style, as he was equally skilled in all phases on the game. In Spassky's best games his pieces seemed to combine together in perfect harmony, and he produced a number of memorable masterpieces. In this book, Grandmaster Zen�n Franco examines in detail Spassky's chess style, selects and studies his favorite Spassky games, and demonstrates how we can all improve our chess by learning from Spassky's play.<br>Move by Move provides an ideal platform to study chess. By continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practicing of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is an excellent way to improve your chess skills and knowledge.<br>*Learn from the games of a chess legend<br>*Important ideas absorbed by continued practice<br>*Utilizes an ideal approach to chess study</p><p>Zen�n Franco is a Grandmaster from Paraguay, now living in Spain. He represented Paraguay, on top board, in seven Chess Olympiads, and won individual gold medals at Lucerne 1982 and Novi Sad 1990. He&#39;s an experienced trainer and has written numerous books on chess.Zenon Franco's massive 464 page work, featuring over 60 of Spassky's best efforts, is arranged by theme ... rather than chronologically. Although there is one game from the 1992 match with Fischer the author wisely draws from Spassky's most fertile period (late 1950s to 1970s) when he was at the peak of his powers&nbsp;and showing the wide range of skills that make him one of the most versatile of the world champions. Again the move by move format is used to engage the reader. Franco's book serves as an excellent introduction to one of the most popular of world champions. We can only hope for a miracle that Spassky, in very poor health, can still find the energy to do his own book of best games. Until then this is the book on Boris.

I grew up in Ortonville, Michigan, a small rural town in the northern part of Oakland County. Imagine your left hand is the state of Michigan; if you were to hold it up in front of you, Ortonville would be an inch over from where the crook of your thumb and first finger meet. Ortonville was (and still is) primarily made up of dirt roads, farms, and a quaint little downtown with that small-community feel. When I was a girl, there were no major shopping malls or fast-food chains, not unless you count the A&amp;W drive-in and the Frosty Boy where we&#x2019;d get ice cream after T-ball games. The lone family restaurant in town had the absolute <i>best</i> breadsticks and kiddy cocktails ever. Next to that, there was a small grocery store. Ortonville, Michigan&#x2014;it was a small town.</p><p>My parents packed up and moved from the city so they could build a beautiful two-story home on a two-acre lot. It was the perfect place to raise a family; there was plenty of space for us kids to run wild, the horses had a small pasture to roam, and we grew a beautiful garden. Our property was complete with a horse corral and a tack room, which held the hay, feed, bridles, and essential grooming gear. The tack room floor was scattered with hay, and my sisters and I spent many afternoons playing there. These days, I can&#x2019;t breathe in the smell of hay and not think of that place and the countless hours I spent playing in it as a young girl.</p><p>Growing up on a farm meant my family had access to the freshest foods and produce. This was one of the many perks of living where I did. Rather than buying eggs at the local market, we had only to stroll out to the chicken coop to collect fresh ones. It&#x2019;s easy, if not tempting, however, to think that collecting fresh eggs from chickens is a leisurely activity&#x2014;movies would have you believe that all you need to do is lift up the roof of a chicken coop and take a freshly laid egg straight from a plump hen&#x2019;s nest. Actually, it&#x2019;s quite the opposite: my family kept a rooster, and we had a deeply rooted fear of him and tried to dodge his attacks while we collected eggs. He&#x2019;d come after you in a heartbeat. Thankfully, I was too young to collect the chicken eggs; my oldest two sisters had the unlucky responsibility of handling that job. I remember a particular time when they escaped from his clutches, bleeding. I never envied them this chore. That said, I&#x2019;ve never tasted better eggs in my life.</p><p>One of the greatest treasures from my childhood was our family garden. I spent many summer days wandering through the rows of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. I recall my parents planting rows of corn, russet potatoes, green beans, peas, carrots, and tomatoes, but my absolute favorite parts of the garden were the strawberry patch and raspberry bush. When I was a kid, you&#x2019;d find me outside at all times riding my bike, catching frogs, and snatching a berry or three (or five) while on my way to our rickety metal swing set. Every once in a while&#x2014;if we were lucky&#x2014;my parents would allow my sisters and me to pull a carrot straight from the soil to eat fresh. We&#x2019;d rinse it off with the garden hose and plop down on the deck steps to eat our prize. Of my many wonderful memories, these moments are among my favorites.</p><p>When I was indoors, I was keenly aware of all the smells coming from our kitchen. My mom&#x2019;s cooking was magical, to say the least&#x2014;she knew how to make three unbelievably delicious meals a day for a large family, sourcing most of the ingredients straight from our backyard or nearby co-op.</p><p>I loved coming home after a day at school to discover we were having baked chicken for dinner that night. I could smell it just moments before entering the house: the wafting scent of spices and baking chicken would linger outside our front door. It was a comforting smell. Some of my earliest food-obsessed memories start at my mother&#x2019;s counter. I&#x2019;d pull up the rusty brown step stool to watch her hands while she kneaded pizza dough, frosted a cake, or stirred a pot of sloppy joe sauce. I can still remember the feeling of the nonslip, sandpaperlike grit under my bare feet while I &#x201c;helped&#x201d; my mom in the kitchen. Even today, her pizza remains one of my favorite dishes: just like when I was growing up, she makes it with a deep golden crust and the perfect smattering of toppings and cheese. She always wore her deep blue and goldenrod&#x2013;trimmed floral apron, which she recently passed down to me, and never failed to turn out the perfect pizza.</p><p>If we were lucky, a homemade dessert would find its way onto the table at the end of a meal. (My fingers were permanently crossed for her Mississippi Mud Pie&#x2014;you can find the recipe here.) The irony of it all, however, is that I was such a picky eater&#x2014;I was the child who hated cooked vegetables; spices always felt too strong on my tongue; baked potatoes induced gag reflexes in my throat (I&#x2019;d even hide whole bites of it in my milk glass and just eat the pats of butter instead); and tomatoes, which in my young mind were sour tasting, would always remain around the edge of my salad bowl. If my mom wasn&#x2019;t home to cook a meal, that would put my dad on dinner duty. And boy, did I put him through the wringer (I knew better than to give my mom a hard time), whining about how I didn&#x2019;t want whatever it was he was making for dinner that night, begging him to just make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead&#x2014;because, truthfully, I could have eaten those every single day. I still could, actually.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>As I grew older, I became less picky. Trying new foods like cheesecake for the first time were big moments for me. I&#x2019;d always been too stubborn to try it because, as a kid, I couldn&#x2019;t begin to comprehend what kind of cake could possibly taste good with <i>cheese</i> in it. (I could kick myself for the years I wasted refusing to try it!) I&#x2019;ve requested cheesecake for every birthday or gathering since that first fateful bite. Guacamole was another one: it was green; therefore, for a long time I thought it was gross. But once I dragged a crisp, salty chip through it and took a bite, I was sold&#x2014;now my family eats guacamole or avocado dip at least twice a week (even my husband loves it, and he was a guacamole hater until he met me).</p><p>So, as my palate and I both matured, my desire to cook and explore my family&#x2019;s cooking traditions grew, too. I fell in love with the feel of chopping vegetables, the sound of sauce simmering, and the sense of triumph as I&#x2019;d pull a homemade cake out of the oven. I&#x2019;d be doubly happy (or impressed with myself!) if the cake was delicious and moist. In high school, at age fourteen, I met Pat, my future husband. Like me, he is one of the pickiest eaters I&#x2019;ve ever known. He&#x2019;s pickier than I ever was, if that&#x2019;s even possible. To this day, if a recipe gets a thumbs-up review from him, I know it&#x2019;s a hit and I not-so-secretly jump for joy.</p><p>In my early twenties, I found I&#x2019;d lost sight of my roots when it came to food. I was a young wife and mother working a full-time job and raising two little girls. I wanted to provide my family with substantial meals, reminiscent of the ones my mother would prepare when I was growing up. I did my best to achieve this, despite how difficult it was to regularly cook three fresh meals a day. Like most American families, I relied on boxed meal substitute, canned soups, processed foods, boxed baking mixes&#x2014;the list goes on and on. It was only a short time ago that I had a bit of a revelation, though. One day, while I was reaching into my pantry for a box of brownie mix, a simple life-changing thought dawned on me: <i>This is </i>not <i>how my mom used to do it</i>. It was a visceral moment. I felt disappointed that I was not cooking healthier meals, that I was letting my girls eat hyperprocessed foods as frequently as, if not more often than, fresh fruits and vegetables. I remember asking myself right then, <i>When did it become the norm that brownies come from a box?</i> Then more questions reverberated through my head as I looked at my pantry:<i> How is it that canned soup is the </i>only <i>way to make a dish creamy and luscious?</i> <i>And does spaghetti sauce have to come from a jar, or is there another way?</i> My mother used to grind her own wheat into flour in our pantry, and there I was making brownies from a mix.</p><p>Then an idea flooded through me: I knew right then and there that I needed to find a way to make these things, everything, from scratch, just as my mother had. I made a pact with myself to do this, and while I knew I didn&#x2019;t have all day to prepare our meals&#x2014;heck, I was a mom and I worked a full-time job&#x2014;I was determined to find a way to eliminate as many boxed, canned, and prepackaged mixes and ingredients from my kitchen as possible. I was going to reinvent the term &#x201c;from scratch&#x201d; and make my kitchen into one just like my family had when I was growing up.</p><p>As the years rolled on, I attempted all kinds of recipes, including ones for household basics such as breads, barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, and ketchup. I adapted some of my mother&#x2019;s treasured classic recipes for my own kitchen, and I dreamed up new ones to share with my girls. I took inspiration from cookbooks and restaurants or from meals with friends and family for new dishes or techniques I&#x2019;d never tried before. I wrote all my successful recipes down in a red composition notebook, and my collection grew rapidly over time. My goal was to develop strategies to maintain a purely from-scratch kitchen, so that our family could eat affordably, conveniently, and more healthfully. Slowly but surely, I successfully removed all hyperprocessed foods from my kitchen. In early 2010, I started my blog, <i>Simply Scratch</i>, to chronicle my from-scratch adventure and share it with friends and family. I quickly realized that people were shocked (impressed?) not only that I was attempting to cook exclusively from scratch, but that I was succeeding. I wanted to show them just how easy a whole-food, from-scratch lifestyle was, and the result has been incredible. <i>Simply Scratch</i> has walked thousands of home cooks&#x2014;moms and dads, novice and experienced home chefs, and foodies&#x2014;step-by-step through my favorite from-scratch recipes. With hundreds of recipes in my archive, my blog has become a go-to resource for home cooks as they plan their meals throughout the week. My blog is my creative outlet, my passion. It humbles me to be connected with readers around the world who write to share their success at making their first recipe from scratch or from those looking for healthier alternatives to avoid additives in prepackaged or canned ingredients. With the success of my blog, I was able to quit my full-time job to blog exclusively, and I&#x2019;ve never looked back. It&#x2019;s a dream come true to be writing this book and to share with you the recipes I hold near and dear.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always believed food forms the bonds that make our memories and family connections. It&#x2019;s very important to me that we all sit down for dinner every night and that Sundays are our family breakfast day. My favorite thing in the world is having my girls help me cook in the kitchen just like I used to help my mom. I find inspiration in everything around me, from seasonal fruits, vegetables, and the herbs that grow in my garden, to dishes I&#x2019;ve had at restaurants that I simply <i>have </i>to make at home because they were so delicious. Basically, I like to cook the meals that I like to eat (who doesn&#x2019;t, right?), and this book is a reflection of that.</p><p>In the beginning of this cookbook you will find recipes for simple pantry basics such as mayo, ketchup, starches, and sauces, items that we all typically buy every week. You&#x2019;ll have the option to make these from scratch and to use them throughout the recipes that follow. You can&#x2019;t go wrong with any of these DIY basics. They&#x2019;re simple, approachable, and without a doubt delicious. To those who fear cooking from scratch is too challenging, I promise you that once you nail down the basics and properly stock your pantry, you&#x2019;ll soon realize that making homemade meals can become as second nature as breathing. Just take your first step. Soon you&#x2019;ll be high-fiving yourself after a darn good 100 percent from-scratch meal!</p><p>Since that fateful day with the brownie mix, it has always been my goal to use fresh, healthy ingredients and to cook from scratch. I hope you enjoy the many scrumptious recipes in this book, as they are tried and true, from my kitchen to yours.</p><p>&#x2014;LAURIE</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Basics</p><p>The Scratch Pantry</p><p>My pantry wasn&#x2019;t always a <i>scratch pantry</i>. If we were to teleport back in time to just six years ago and land smack-dab in the center of my old kitchen, my cooking&#x2014;and my life&#x2014;would be in stark contrast to what it is today. First, it would literally be a different kitchen, since we moved a few years ago. But you&#x2019;d also see clearly that I seriously lacked confidence as a home cook.</p><p>My old, white-veneered, plywood pantry cabinet was a very well-loved and well-used treasure from Target, but it also was a mess. It was stuffed, in no order, with cans of cream-of-whatever soup, jars of premade pasta sauce, baking supplies, not to mention several opened bags of chocolate chips crammed into ziplock baggies (to satisfy my occasional craving for a spoonful of peanut butter topped with chocolate chips). There was also a basket filled with jarred herbs, spices and spice blends, boxes of macaroni and cheese, eight different kinds of cereal, and usually a box of brownie mix. Okay, so maybe two boxes, <i>plus</i> a tub of frosting. I cringe. My husband once used the term &#x201c;food hoarder&#x201d; to describe me, and while I try not to say this <i>too </i>often, he was completely right.</p><p>Today, I would proudly show you my pantry and cupboards: they&#x2019;re tidy and organized, and over the years they&#x2019;ve been transformed into well-stocked shelves with crucial from-scratch cooking necessities. No canned soups, boxed mixes, or jars of sauce. (I&#x2019;ve even got a shelf dedicated to lots of different vinegars. Some habits are hard to break, and buying infused vinegars is a weakness of mine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.)</p><p>But it took a while to get from point A to point B. When I decided to start cooking exclusively from scratch, I faced a frustratingly simple (but terrifying) question: <i>Where do I</i> even<i> begin?</i> I vividly remember looking around at my kitchen while trying to decide what to do first. <i>Should I toss the Cheez-Its and frostings and cake mixes, and empty every square inch of my cupboard? Or should I just eat everything in sight so I&#x2019;m not wasting all that money by throwing everything in the trash? Do I need to go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and purchase every pot, pan, and kitchen tool known to man? </i>It seemed pretty daunting, even overwhelming, and I was suddenly regretting never having a wedding shower.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Right down to my cooking tools, I literally had to start from scratch.</p><p>But here&#x2019;s the best advice I learned to keep in mind as you get started: you don&#x2019;t have to make the transition all at once, but once you make the decision, begin making changes at your very next trip to the grocery store.

Born in Pittsburgh to the owner of a sewing machine factory, she wrote fiction in her spare time until a stock market crash sent her and her husband into debt, forcing her to lean on her writing to pay the bills. Her first two novels, <em>The Circular Staircase</em> (1908) and <em>The Man in Lower Ten</em> (1909), established her as a bright young talent, and it wasn&#x2019;t long before she was a regular on bestseller lists.Among her dozens of novels were <em>The Amazing Adventures of Letitia Carberry</em> (1911) and <em>The Bat</em> (1932), which was among the inspirations for Bob Kane&#x2019;s Batman. Today, Rinehart is often called an American Agatha Christie, even though she was much more popular than Christie during her heyday.</p><p><strong>Otto Penzler</strong> is the proprietor of the Mysterious Bookshop in New York City.

In her historical novel, first published in 1953, Giles invited the reader to experience the danger and beauty of life on the American frontier.<br><br>Many of the frontiersmen were hunters in search of escape from an ever-advancing civilization, seeking freedom and space. Such a man was David Cooper, who had hunted the Kentucky wilderness with Daniel Boone before the first settlers crossed the Appalachians. No love of land or home or woman had been strong enough to hold David&#x2015;until he met Bethia. It was for her that he cleared his patch of forest, planted crops, and built a cabin. Too late, he learned that the girl he had dreamed of marrying was the wife of his enemy.<br><br>David and Bethia belonged to a generation that never knew or expected security, and the background of their story is one of turmoil: Outnumbered and ill-equipped, early settlers were hard put to defend their forts; and, although united in war against the British and their Indian allies, they were often at odds among themselves. Many, including Boone, held land grants from Judge Henderson's Transylvania Company. Others, like David, based their claims on the authority of Virginia. Few today realize how close the British came to winning out.<br><br>In her research, Giles studied the journals of the early Kentuckians and has retold their story in their own easy-flowing, cadenced prose.

Lakes are changing rapidly, not because we are separate from nature but because we are so much a part of it. While many of our effects on the natural world today are new, from climate change to nuclear fallout, our connections to it are ancient, as core samples from lake beds reveal. In <em>Still Waters</em>, Curt Stager introduces us to the secret worlds hidden beneath the surfaces of our most remarkable lakes, leading us on a journey from the pristine waters of the Adirondack Mountains to the wilds of Siberia, from Thoreau&#x2019;s cherished pond to the Sea of Galilee.</p><p>Through decades of firsthand investigations, Stager examines the significance of our impacts on some of the world&#x2019;s most iconic inland waters. Along the way he discovers the stories these lakes contain about us, including our loftiest philosophical ambitions and our deepest myths. For him, lakes are not only mirrors reflecting our place in the natural world but also windows into our history, culture, and the primal connections we share with all life.</p><p>Beautifully observed and eloquently written, Stager&#x2019;s narrative is filled with strange and enchanting details about these submerged worlds&#x2015;diving insects chirping underwater like crickets, African crater lakes that explode, and the growing threats to some of our most precious bodies of water. Modern science has demonstrated that humanity is an integral part of nature on this planet, so intertwined with it that we have also become an increasingly powerful force of nature in our own right. <em>Still Waters</em> reminds us how beautiful, complex, and vulnerable our lakes are, and how, more than ever, it is essential to protect them.</p> 37 photographs</p><p>Curt Stager is a professor of natural sciences at Paul Smith&#x2019;s College in New York.

For those of us who love the planet's lakes, this is like a long, cool drink of the freshest water.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bill McKibben, author of <em>Falter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Curt Stager is an eloquent storyteller. He not only guides us into the fascinating ecological worlds that dwell within lakes but also demonstrates that our own nature, both biological and cultural, cannot be understood apart from our many interconnections with these living waters.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David George Haskell, author of <em>The Songs of Trees</em> and <em>The Forest Unseen</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lakes reflect us both literally and metaphorically, in ways shallow and deep. We can see our faces as we peer into their surface. But more deeply, lakes also reflect how the world is changing. Curt Stager has written a deep book about lakes. He peers into deep time, letting lakes tell us what has been, as well as foretelling a bit about who we are becoming.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Carl Safina, author of <em>A Sea In Flames</em> and <em>Beyond Worlds: What Animals Think and Feel</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Curt Stager takes his readers into the depths of ponds, lakes and seas around the globe&#x2015;both polluted and pristine, ancient and nearly new&#x2015;and brings alive the universe of life contained within each. Picking up the torch lit by Thoreau more than 150 years ago, <em>Still Waters</em> plumbs a question that vexes ecologists and philosophers alike&#x2015;Can waters so shaped by human hands ever again be considered 'natural'? His conclusions will surprise as much as they entertain and educate.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dan Egan, author of <em>The Death and Life of the Great Lakes</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An outstanding work of nature and science writing that lingers long after the book is closed.

Arguably the man who introduced the Renaissance to France, Francis was also the prototype Frenchman&#x2014;a national identity was modeled on his character. So great was his stamp, that few countries even now are quite so robustly patriotic as is France. Yet as Leonie Frieda reveals, Francis did not always live up to his ideal; a man of grand passions and vision, he was also a flawed husband, father, lover, and king.</p><p>With access to private archives that have never been used in a study of Francis I, Frieda explores the life of a man who was the most human of the monarchs of the period&#x2014;and yet, remains the most elusive.</p></p><p><p><strong>Francis I was inconstant, amorous, hotheaded, and flawed.

With these four words Cleopatra poses a simple but fundamental human problem: What can we know? She and Antony have known each other for years, at times gloriously&#x2014;emotionally, mentally, and in the archaic sense of the word, physically&#x2014;but still the challenge of knowing hangs in the air. Cleopatra's question reminds us that knowledge is not simple: that it is as likely to create yearning as satisfaction; that it is not confined to any one part of the self; that it is far from intellect alone. It reminds us&#x2014;as do most great plays&#x2014;that life is part wonder, part terror.<br><br>What can we know? This study&#x2014;aimed at students, teachers, and theater artists&#x2014;suggests that the attempt to know the dramaturgy of a play is little different from the attempt to know another person for whom we care.<br><br>Toward a Dramaturgical Sensibility explores the interplay between the known and the unknown from two perspectives&#x2014;landscape and journey. Part I (Landscape) is divided into three chapters. Chapter 1 surveys this landscape using conversation to better understand the role of conversation in our work with a play and with our collaborators. Chapter 2 explores ways in which pleasure guides and informs knowledge by focusing first on the landscape of time, particularly how time makes all pleasure (and pain) temporary; then considers the landscape of research, particularly the ambivalence among dramaturges about this word. Chapter 3 looks at the pattern that is a play's landscape&#x2014;surveying methods of dramaturgical analysis and the role of methodology itself.<br><br>Part II (Journey) moves to rehearsal for Antony and Cleopatra at the Guthrie Theater in the fall of 2001 and winter of 2002&#x2014;a production directed by Mark Lamos with Laila Robins as Cleopatra, Robert Cuccioli as Antony, and Stephen Yoakum as Enobarbus. This case study follows that journey from first contact with script and production team to final preview, as explored by artists willing to accept the challenges created by any serious encounter with a play. Part II allows the Landscapes of Part I to resonate inside a more or less chronological account of one particular journey&#x2014;as we engage, explore, and respond to a play's dramaturgy.</p><p>Geoffrey S.

Although Italy had been a geographical label since Roman times, the idea that a distinctive Italian people inhabited the boot-shaped peninsula and its islands was more recent, and the notion that they should have an independent state of their own more recent still. Only with the French Revolutions attack on the principles of absolutism and divinely ordained hierarchy could such an idea gain ground, and only with the rise of nationalism as the political creed of the nineteenth century could &#34;Italy for the Italians&#34; become the new watchword. But creating a sense of common Italian identity among the people of the peninsula was no easy matter. Not only were they not accustomed to being part of the same country, few of them spoke Italian, 97 percent speaking a kaleidoscope of dialects and languages that were in good part mutually unintelligible. In the aftermath of Napoleons defeat in 1814, the Italian nationalist movement faced a peninsula that was divided into a patchwork of states and duchies propped up by foreign forces, the Austrian empire foremost among them. But the nationalists were not entirely discouraged, for they knew that autocratic mini-states were vulnerable to the wrath of their subjects from within and to armies from without. Assorted dukes and kings had painfully learned the latter lesson when Napoleons armies had, not many years earlier, swept through the peninsula and deposed them all. For Italys nationalists, then, the most daunting obstacle was not the Austrian occupation of northeastern It- aly, nor the tottering Bourbon monarchy that ruled all of the South and Sicily, nor the assorted dukes and their duchies. No, there was a far greater power, a far more imposing foe, one that cut the peninsula in two, blocking North from South, its capital the legendary city of Romulus and Remus, the symbol of Italys ancient greatness. For more than a thousand years the popes had ruled over these Papal States, a swath of territory that extended from Rome northward through Umbria and the Marches to Ferrara and Bologna. Deposing the duke of Modena or the grandduke of Tuscany, or even driving the Austrians out of Lombardy and Veneto, was one thing. Deposing the pope from his thousand-year earthly reign was something very different, for the pope, though having little in the way of military might, had weapons that no other ruler could ever hope to wield. What the pope had was the belief - enshrined in official Church dogma and pronounced by parish priests throughout the land - that he ruled over a divinely ordained kingdom as Gods representative on earth. The creation of a unified Italian state, the pope insisted - and in this he had centuries of Church teachings to back him up - was contrary to Gods wishes. It could only be accomplished by force, and anyone taking part in such an assault would be throwing in h</p><h2>Emma Curtis Hopkins: Forgotten Founder of New Thought (Women and Gender in Religion)</h2><p>Emma Curtis Hopkins led a life of extraordinary diversity and achievement. Here at last is a study that salutes her remarkable life as it explores the route by which she melded spiritual healing, metaphysical idealism, and exotic philosophies into multiple careers of unsurpassed dynamic. As a charismatic teacher, Hopkins instructed or ordained every prominent New Thought leader who founded a major denomination of the movement&#x2019;s churches. Her considerable talents as a mystic and noted author reached fruition with the publication of High Mysticism in 1923. Furthermore, her ideas on healing and prosperity took root in both secular and religious organizations, touching millions around the globe to this day. The long-forgotten Hopkins is now given her due in a book that allows her to triumph in the roles she so ably mastered in life: mentor and mystic, healer and feminist, missionary and biblical prophet, writer and editor.</p><p>Gail M. Harley teaches in religious studies at the University of South Florida, Tampa. She also writes guest editorials for the St. Petersburg Times and the Tacoma News Tribune.Harley (religious studies, Univ. of South Florida; Women Building Chicago, 1770-1990: A Biographical Dictionary) provides a critical biography of an overlooked spiritual revolutionary. Initially inspired by Mary Baker Eddy, who focused on interpreting the Christian scriptures, Emma Curtis Hopkins (1853-1925) broke away to develop a more eclectic form of metaphysical idealism that came to be known as the New Thought. In her version of the Christian Trinity, she imagined three aspects of God, who played a role in different historical periods: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Mother-Spirit. Using this theology, she established an ordained ministry for New Thought that actively encouraged the membership of women (Hopkins herself became the first American woman to ascend to the episcopacy). This illuminating biography, well documented through quotations from Hopkins's letters, helps to reveal a unique religious thinker as well as the religious climate of late 19th-century America. The only study on Hopkins available, it will surely find an audience with feminists, historians, religious scholars, and the general public. Recommended for large public libraries, as well as seminary and feminist collections. Carolyn M.

These eight firsthand accounts are among the best ever written. They were selected for the power with which they portray the hardship, adventure, and boundless love for friends and family that characterized the overland experience. Some were written with the skilled pens of educated women. Others bear the marks of crude cabin learning, with archaic and imaginative spelling and a simplicity of expression. All convey the profound effect the westward trek had on these women.<p>For too long these diaries and letters were secreted away in attics and basements or collected dust on the shelves of manuscript collections across the country. Their publication gives us a fresh perspective on the pioneer experience.</p></p><p><p><b>Kenneth L.

Deploying her extraordinary imagination to the task of recreating the inner lives and outer trials of Scott and his team, Bainbridge gives us a study in the nature and action of charisma and in the place of duty and aspiration in all our lives.</p><p>Beryl Bainbridge's historical fiction should be required reading. Her complex portraits of people and events allow us to experience the possibilities of the past. In this novel, we view Robert Scott's 1912 Antarctic expedition through her incomparable lens. For her facts, she draws upon actual letters, journal accounts, and the memoirs of Apsley Cherry-Garrard, one of the survivors. Gordon Griffin's performance is masterful. His characterizations imply confusion in the seemingly self-assured and bravery in unlikely heroes. These explorers harbor petty jealousies yet offer the potential for courageous acts. Griffin presents them with little sentimentality, boisterous enthusiasm,and the distinct sense of children boasting. Bainbridge's mono-logues expose ingrained prejudices and class distinctions, casting light on the shadows found even in good men's souls. S.J.H. � AudioFile 2002, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Bainbridge, the idiosyncratic English author whose best-known books here are probably The Bottle Factory Outing and The Dressmaker , has never gained the American audience she deserves. The fact that this gripping, moving and hair-raisingly readable novel has taken three years to achieve publication here--and then only by a courageous and enterprising smaller publisher--suggests that Americans are still slightly wary of her. Readers should abandon such caution immediately, for this is by far her best book to date: a riveting account told in shifting first-person narratives by the key members of the doomed Antarctic expedition led by Captain Scott in 1912. It has been written about often before, and memorably filmed, but Bainbridge's cunningly fictionalized account leaves others standing. She takes on, in turn, the voices of burly, roistering Welsh Petty Officer Taff Evans; sweet-natured, scholarly, all-forgiving Dr. Edward (Uncle Bill) Wilson; Captain Robert Falcon Scott himself, a memorably complex man with a strong gift for command overlying deep inner fears and anxieties; Lieut. Henry (Birdie) Bowers, an endlessly energetic, curious, squat adventurer who has roved the world's perilous places alone; and aloof, sardonic, aristocratic Capt. Lawrence (Titus) Oates, a rich man beginning to realize his essential humanity in the months before his death. Every Englishman knows the agonizing end of their story, only hinted at in the book by a schoolgirl's map of their final death march back from the South Pole after being beaten there by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. A whole lost era of fantastic courage, determination, idealism, curiosity, boyish foolishness and class mores is brought brilliantly and touchingly back by Bainbridge's penetrating psychological acumen and her superb scene and action painting. The beauty and horror of the desolate landscapes, the painful limits of human endurance and bravery, are unforgettably caught in prose that is as swift, cool and clear as ice melt. A masterly achievement, not to be missed by anyone who cherishes a strong, meaningful story beautifully told. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Monon, Revised Second Edition: The Hoosier Line</h2><p><p>After almost a quarter of a century, Monon: The Hoosier Line is back in print in a revised second edition featuring an updated Epilogue, additional photographs, and a new Afterword by Frank Van Bree, President of the Monon Railroad Historical-Technical Society, Inc.</p><p>Many railroads served the state, but the Monon was Indiana&#x2019;s own. If you wanted to travel from Delphi to Broad Ripple, or from Gosport to Smithville, you took the Monon. The self-proclaimed "Hoosier Line" celebrated its heritage by naming its flagship passenger train The Hoosier, featuring Indiana cooking in the dining cars and offering homespun service. Monon celebrates the history of this magnificent railroad, from its inception in 1847 as the New Albany &amp; Salem Rail Road, then as the Louisville, New Albany &amp; Chicago, to its merger in 1970 with the L&amp;N, and beyond. The informative text is enhanced by 258 black-and-white illustrations and a special color insert, "The Monon in Color," with 17 additional photographs.</p></p><p><p>Gary W. Dolzall has no difficulty explaining his fascination with the Monon. Living first in Bedford and then in Bloomington, Indiana, he spent his first two decades near Hoosier Line rails. A lifelong student of the railroad ndustry, Gary has written numerous magazine articles and three books in addition to this one: Diesels from Eddystone: The Story of Baldwin Diesel Locomotives (with Stephen Dolzall), and Steel Rails across America and The Spirit of Railroading (with Mike Danneman). Other interests include model railroading, auto racing, and the American Civil War; on the latter subject he has also published a number of magazine articles.

Dolzall received a Lionel train set at age two which served to establish a lifelong interest in railroading. A family move to Bedford, Indiana, in 1948, afforded Steve first a glimpse at Monon steam and later a ringside seat for the final chapter of the Monon story. In addition, Steve has also co-authored Diesels from Eddystone: The Story of Baldwin Diesel Locomotives and several magazine articles with Gary. Although the Monon remains a favorite, other specialties are the products of all the locomotive builders and the history of railroads in southern Indiana. His other interests include model railroading, the Indianapolis 500, automobile restoration, and automotive history. Steve is a graduate of Indiana University.

Gabe felt his face flush slightly, but he&#x2019;d learned enough about the world to know when to bluster his way through.</p><p>Yeah, Mad had taught him that, too.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Ogilvie, I don&#x2019;t understand why my friends are here. Maybe they were out after curfew, but it&#x2019;s no secret that nearly every student is from time to time.&#x201d; Another thing Gabe had learned was when to throw himself on his sword. God, he was going to miss his friends. If his stupid dick got him expelled, he had no illusions about what would happen. His parents would ship him to another prep school, and he would have to start all over. &#x201c;Please, if you&#x2019;ll let them off the hook, I&#x2019;ll admit to everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Martyr,&#x201d; Mad coughed like the idiotic douche he could be.</p><p>Gabe very slowly lifted his hand behind his back and shot his bestie the middle finger.</p><p>Connor Sparks stepped up. &#x201c;No, Gabe. We went into this together. We go down together.&#x201d; He frowned. &#x201c;I wish I could have played against Exeter. It&#x2019;s going to be hard to miss out on the league championship.&#x201d;</p><p>Daxton Spencer shook his head, following Connor&#x2019;s lead. &#x201c;Yeah, I think the whole school will be deeply disappointed. Without our captain, we&#x2019;re sure to lose.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Smart bastards.</i> Gabe repressed a smile and couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a spark of hope. Creighton took lacrosse and the league championship very seriously. It brought money and prestige to a school that valued both greatly.</p><p>The counselor, who in Gabe&#x2019;s opinion had always had it out for them, leaned forward. &#x201c;If you think for one second that sports will save you from the punishment you&#x2019;ve earned, you&#x2019;re wrong. This establishment has rules, and I follow them. I&#x2019;ve seen the video evidence. It&#x2019;s disgusting. Perverse. What is wrong with you boys?&#x201d;</p><p>Dax and Connor looked around, then at one another, and shrugged.</p><p>Mad grinned as if silently admitting their list of faults was long and distinguished.</p><p>&#x201c;You think this is funny? Expulsion is the only acceptable outcome for this mess. We raise <i>gentlemen</i> at this school, and you six have proven you&#x2019;re anything but. And you, Mr. Hayes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Ogilvie turned to Zachary Hayes, the quietest of the six.</p><p>Their contemplative buddy never made a move without thinking through the outcomes and consequences first. Zack frowned.</p><p>Gabe felt his stomach drop. God, he was getting Zack kicked out. Zack, the freaking class president and valedictorian. The one with the brightest future.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised at you,&#x201d; the counselor continued. &#x201c;I knew you would find nothing but trouble when you fell in with this crowd. I believe I warned you.&#x201d;</p><p>All eyes turned back to Zack. With dark hair and winter blue eyes, Zack often seemed ready to permanently retreat inward. He&#x2019;d been at Creighton for two months before Gabe had really talked to him. Mad had been the one to bring the quiet kid into their group. Gabe had soon realized that Zack was smart and funny&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and could sometimes figure a way out of a bind. For five years, it had been the six of them against the world. They shouldn&#x2019;t have fit. Connor and Dax had naturally become pals because they were both athletes. Roman and Zack were the obviously ambitious types. And somehow he&#x2019;d been the nerd taken under the wing of the most obnoxious, devious-minded rich boy at school, Maddox Crawford.</p><p>They felt like brothers, and he couldn&#x2019;t be the one who fucked up everything. In a year, they would graduate and they had plans to attend Yale together. They&#x2019;d coached Connor through trig and made sure he&#x2019;d gotten an A so they wouldn&#x2019;t be separated in the future. One for all and all for one, and all that shit.</p><p>Maybe his dream was about to be dashed, but he wasn&#x2019;t going to screw over his friends. They had a pact.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my fault. I blackmailed them into sneaking out with me.&#x201d; He was willing to tell any lie that might work.</p><p>&#x201c;Dude, that was weak.&#x201d; Dax rolled his eyes. &#x201c;Like anyone would believe that. Look, Mr. Ogilvie, you know how the press is, willing to say anything salacious about us rich boys to make a buck. Do you really want <i>People</i> magazine running an article that exaggerates about Creighton&#x2019;s super entitled boys running wild and taking women who have barely given their dubious consent to bed?&#x201d;</p><p>Gabe gaped at his friend. <i>What the hell?</i> &#x201c;Her consent wasn&#x2019;t dubious, asshole.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The press won&#x2019;t care,&#x201d; Roman pointed out, then turned to the counselor. &#x201c;That scandal won&#x2019;t look good for the school, either.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t make my decisions based on the press, only the rules of this school. And I fully intend to talk to my counterpart at Murray Heights this afternoon. Miss Jones will be dismissed by the end of the day. I have no doubt they will call the proper authorities as well. No school worth a whit wants a sex offender working on campus.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Shit.</i> He&#x2019;d landed a nice, remarkably limber young lady in a heap of trouble. Hell, <i>he&#x2019;d</i> come on to <i>her</i>. She&#x2019;d simply been trying to help a guy have fun. Why should her good deed be punished?</p><p>Gabe raked a hand through his hair. His day sucked. He needed to hang it up and become the loner he&#x2019;d been before Mad had taken him in and shown him how to stand up for himself. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He can&#x2019;t for two reasons: First, the age of consent in the state of New York is seventeen, so engaging in sexual relations with Miss Jones wasn&#x2019;t illegal, and she is, therefore, not a sex offender. Second, I don&#x2019;t recall that sexual intercourse with another consenting adult is an offense one can be expelled for. If that&#x2019;s the case, Ogilvie would have to expel most of the senior class, especially if they&#x2019;ve met Augustine Spencer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey! That&#x2019;s my sister you&#x2019;re talking about,&#x201d; Dax objected.</p><p>&#x201c;What? She&#x2019;s a giver. I mean that in the nicest possible way,&#x201d; Roman assured. &#x201c;But back to the point. Ogilvie could probably have Ms. Jones fired&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but he has no proof the incident ever occurred.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I have proof. I saw the tape.&#x201d;</p><p>Roman turned with the smooth expertise of a kid who&#x2019;d spent his share of time in mock trials and won them all. &#x201c;Mr. Bond, did you sign a release or in any way give Mr. Crawford permission to tape you in coitus with the lovely Miss Jones?&#x201d;</p><p>He shot a nasty look Mad&#x2019;s way. &#x201c;No. Hell no, and don&#x2019;t be stupid. If I had known, I would have clocked the fucker.&#x201d; Ogilvie&#x2019;s bushy brows slashed down in a judgmental scowl, and Gabe remembered where he was. &#x201c;I mean, I was entirely unaware and would have protested vociferously had I realized the encounter was being taped.&#x201d;</p><p>Gabe <i>had</i> decked him afterward. He&#x2019;d broken Mad&#x2019;s nose, but Mad just seemed to view it as one more story he could tell over beers someday. He&#x2019;d shrugged it away, like he did everything else&#x2014;with the negligent grace of a man who knew there was a billion dollar trust fund waiting for him at the end of the yellow brick road of prep school.</p><p>&#x201c;I might have forgotten to ask.&#x201d; Mad smiled benignly. &#x201c;You know art doesn&#x2019;t apologize.&#x201d;</p><p>And neither did Mad.</p><p>Roman slapped his hands together in jubilation. &#x201c;I believe we&#x2019;ll discover that Miss Jones was unaware as well. In this state, no recordings, video or audio, may be made or used as evidence in a civil trial without the informed consent of one of the participants. They can fire her for moral turpitude, but they need that tape to hold up in a court of law. Since there was no consent to tape the encounter and it happened out of the public eye, that tape won&#x2019;t hold up and Murray Heights lawyers will likely advise the administrators not to open the school to a lawsuit they can&#x2019;t win. I&#x2019;m afraid you don&#x2019;t have a tape.&#x201d;</p><p>Ogilvie&#x2019;s face had turned a florid shade. &#x201c;Listen here, you little shit, this isn&#x2019;t some court case. I don&#x2019;t need permission. You&#x2019;re all being expelled and there&#x2019;s not a damn thing you can do about it. This school turns out not simply gentlemen, but <i>perfect</i> gentlemen. Do you know how long I&#x2019;ve wanted to get rid of you, Maddox Crawford? I&#x2019;ve anticipated this day, longed for it, since the moment you walked through those doors, you overindulged bastard. I&#x2019;m taking you down&#x2014;and sending your friends with you just to make you miserable.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is this because I pulled that prank on your car your first year here? You need to get over that.&#x201d; Mad rolled his eyes.</p><p>Of course this was happening because Mad had done something stupid.</p><p>What the hell was Gabe going to do without them? He couldn&#x2019;t fathom it. He even hated summer breaks. He would go to his parents&#x2019; place in the Hamptons and sit like a piece of furniture because he didn&#x2019;t fit in there. The only part of going home he enjoyed was seeing his little sister, Sara. Besides her, he&#x2019;d only ever fit with these five guys. One way or another, they&#x2019;d all been on the outside. Gabe studied too much. Zack was an introvert. Roman spent much of his time with his head in a law text. Dax&#x2019;s father was some bigwig in the navy and his mother was a New Orleans socialite. Connor was a scholarship kid with nothing in his pockets. And to most, Mad was an asswipe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. though a strangely likeable one. Gabe had never been more attached to other people in his life and he had zero idea how he would survive without them.</p><p>They all stopped, looking at each other as though trying to process the fact that their prep school cocoon was over.</p><p>Ogilvie took a long breath. &#x201c;Good. Now you understand how the world works, boys. When you fall in with a bad crowd, you get taken down with them. You may all go and pack. I&#x2019;ll be speaking to your parents this afternoon. And good riddance to you, Crawford.&#x201d;</p><p>For once, Mad didn&#x2019;t have a pithy comeback. He&#x2019;d gone stony, his eyes blank.</p><p>How was this happening? They weren&#x2019;t bad guys. They looked after each other. They&#x2019;d only wanted a drink, and Emily Jones had been so damn pretty, Gabe hadn&#x2019;t thought twice.</p><p>Gabe was about to turn around and walk out when Zack finally spoke, his voice low and filled with an authority none of them had ever heard before.</p><p>&#x201c;I know how the world works, Mr. Ogilvie.&#x201d; Zack stood and straightened his tie. &#x201c;Do you know about the Brighton Endowment?&#x201d;</p><p>The counselor snorted. &#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s an annual three-million-dollar grant. It means a great deal to this school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It does. Did you know my father is very good friends with the donors responsible for that endowment? They listen to him. William Markovic considers me a second son, in fact. If you go through with this, I will have a long conversation with Mr. Markovic, and this school will find itself three million dollars short next year&#x2014;and every year thereafter. I&#x2019;ll ensure the rest of the staff and faculty know exactly why. I think you might find yourself out of a job as well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have that kind of power,&#x201d; Ogilvie blustered.</p><p>&#x201c;You think I don&#x2019;t? My father was the ambassador to Russia for years. He&#x2019;s been close friends with the last three presidents, including the current commander-in-chief. My father wants one thing and one thing only from me. Everyone who&#x2019;s met him knows that he gets what he wants. My future is mapped out. If I do the right things&#x2014;get the grades, remain class president, go to the appropriate college&#x2014;then I accomplish everything I should. If you derail me from this path, I&#x2019;ll get my ass kicked in ways that would make your head spin. But it will end even worse for you. I recently got my SATs back. I had a perfect score. I&#x2019;m getting into Yale, and Skull and Bones will be waiting for me senior year because they know what my father&#x2019;s friends have already figured out: I will be the president of the United States one day. Now, you can be my friend or my enemy. You decide.&#x201d;</p><p>Ogilvie said nothing for a long moment, then he cursed under his breath, not quite meeting Zack&#x2019;s gaze.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you understand me. You&#x2019;re a low-level counselor, so I&#x2019;m going to stop wasting my time here and make an appointment with the dean. He takes my calls, you see. You can&#x2019;t get rid of us. I&#x2019;ll also make sure the lovely Miss Jones suffers no ill effects. Since my friend here was smart enough to use a condom, I don&#x2019;t expect any other complications. I&#x2019;m also going to assume that Dax and Connor did the right thing and destroyed that tape.&#x201d;</p><p>Connor gave him a thumbs-up. &#x201c;We burned it early this morning, but we&#x2019;d planned to mention that later.&#x201d; Because they&#x2019;d had to break into Ogilvie&#x2019;s office to finish the deed.</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; Mad cursed. &#x201c;That was a good piece of film.&#x201d;</p><p>Zack sighed. &#x201c;Someday you&#x2019;re going to go too far, Mad, and I only hope we can save you then. As for this time, we didn&#x2019;t do anything but be young and stupid. Miss Jones is single, and because Gabe has a five-o&#x2019;clock shadow by noon and a surprisingly large dick, I understand how she might have believed he was older. The only one who did anything criminal was dumbass over here.&#x201d; He pointed to Mad.</p><p>&#x201c;It was?&#x201d; Mad tossed his head to flip his hair out of his eyes. &#x201c;I just thought it was a beautiful act that should be recorded for posterity.&#x201d;</p><p>With a shake of his head, Zack went on. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re finished now, ...</p></p><h2>Freedom From Lyme Disease: New Treatments for a Complete Recovery</h2><p><b>PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:</b><p></p><p> "Bryan Rosner has conducted extensive research and thinks outside the box, and this book provides new insight into Lyme disease treatment options."</p><p> <i>-Richard Horowitz, MD, Author of the New York Times Bestselling Book, Why Can't I Get Better: Solving the Mystery of Lyme and Chronic Disease. Dr. Horowitz has treated over 12,000 Lyme Disease patients.</i> </p><p></p><p> "It has been over 10 years since Bryan's first book on Lyme disease. Since then, Bryan has continued to look for ways to help himself and others. In Freedom From Lyme Disease, Bryan shares observations from his journey as well as protocols and treatment options that he has found to be the most valuable. Often times, patient experience leads us to some of the most helpful approaches for recovering from Lyme disease.

That book, which sold over 15,000 copies, established a foundational treatment plan for Lyme disease based on Rosner's extensive research and personal experience. </p><p></p><p> Now, Rosner's newest book, "Freedom from Lyme Disease," builds on the principles set forth in the earlier book. </p><p></p><p> Rosner wrote "Freedom from Lyme Disease" because he observed what he describes as a tipping point in new Lyme disease information and treatment strategies. The tipping point came in 2013, at which time Rosner began working on the new book. Rosner describes this tipping point as a milestone in which there was a fundamental change in how Lyme disease should be approached and treated. "Freedom from Lyme Disease" contains newly discovered treatment modalities and strategies that have the potential to shorten the duration of recovery from Lyme disease.</p><p></p><p> Rosner believes that "Freedom from Lyme Disease" is the most important book he's ever written, as it ties together many of the concepts introduced in his previous books. </p><p></p><p> What sets Rosner's writing apart from other Lyme disease books is that he focuses not just on describing available treatments, but also on how to coordinate and weave these treatments into a customized, individualized treatment plan. He refers to this flexible and unique treatment plan as the "treatment template." While many available books offer information on cutting-edge treatments, few provide guidance on how those treatments should be used in the broader context of a complex and individualized treatment protocol.</p><p></p><p> <b>Check Amazon for Bryan's other books: "Lyme Disease &amp; Rife Machines" and "The Top 10 Lyme Disease Treatments."</b></p></p><p><b>TABLE OF CONTENTS * 438 Pages</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>Foreword by Jon Sterngold, MD</b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>Preface: The Librarians of the Lyme Disease World</b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>Before You Get Started: Information for the Reader - Please Read This First!</b><b></b><b></b>How This Book Is OrganizedTreatment Protocols vs. Individual Treatments--What's the Difference?About Part 2 and Why We Need "How-To" InformationLyme Disease Terminology and Lyme Disease "Beginners"What You Can Expect To Get Out Of This Book"Peeling Layers Off the Onion"DosagesShould You Listen to Me?My Opinion About Lyme Disease Testing, and Testing in GeneralLyme Doctors: What Sets Them Apart?How This Book Relates to the Past Lyme Disease Books I've WrittenThis Book's Strengths and WeaknessesWith Lyme Disease, Problem-Solving Skills Beat Book Knowledge&nbsp;<i>PART 1</i><i>Designing a Treatment Template</i>&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 1: Introduction: Taking Small Steps Toward a Cure</b>Lyme Disease Treatment: A Work in Progress&nbsp;<b>CHAPTER 2: The Lessons of the Last Years: Where We've Been and Where We Are Going</b>Which Category Do You Fall Into?The Last 10% of HealingThe Co-InfectionsSupporting the Body During RecoveryWhy is It So Hard to Get Better?The Rubber Band Principle&nbsp;<b>Chapter 3: The Antibiotic Rotation Protocol, Revamped and Revisited, with New Principles for Use</b>IntroductionBasic Concepts Underpinning the Antibiotic Rotation ProtocolExtending the Rotational Protocol Beyond Antimicrobial TherapiesRotating Supportive Therapies: Further DiscussionHow Over-Supplementation Can Retard the Body's Own Healing EnergyWhat About Rife Machine Therapy?Three Ways to Feel Better FastAdvanced Principles for Using the Antibiotic Rotation ProtocolFinal Words on Building Your Treatment Template&nbsp;<i>PART 2</i><i>The New Treatment Protocols</i>&nbsp;<b>Chapter 4: The Paleo Diet for Lyme Disease (and Other Nutrition Hacks)&nbsp;</b>Why the Paleo Diet?Fat and Protein: The Foundation of the Paleo Food PyramidHow Fat and Cholesterol Provide Specific Benefits to People Healing From Lyme DiseaseProteinWhey Protein &amp; Dairy ProductsBut What About the Vegetables?FruitCarbohydrates: Treating Them as Rocket FuelSaying Goodbye to Grains and GlutenPutting It Into Practice: Meal and Snack ExamplesSnack IdeasThe Marvelous Paleo SmoothiePaleo Hot ChocolatePaleo Ice CreamThe Green SmoothieThe Right Smoothie at the Right TimeTips for Success with Your Healthy Eating Plan&nbsp;<b>Chapter 5: Adrenal Fatigue, Part I: Physical Symptoms and Physical</b><b>Treatments</b>Adrenal Fatigue: A Condition That Affects Body, Mind, and SpiritIntroductionSymptoms of Adrenal FatigueEmotional SymptomsTreating Adrenal FatigueB Vitamins, Vitamin C, and Food ChoicesAdaptogenic HerbsHormone Supplementation and GlandularsTips for Recovery, with a Focus on Lyme DiseaseAdditional Resources&nbsp;<b>Chapter 6: Adrenal Fatigue, Part II: A New Worldview--Asking Basic Questions about Life as a Human Being</b>Moving from the Physical to the Non-PhysicalModern Life and Human PsychologyMy Own Journey Out of That Deep, Dark HoleChoosing Good Role ModelsPeople Pleasing, Perfectionism, and Taking Care of YourselfManaging ExpectationsChoosing Financial SimplicityAccepting YourselfThe Triangle of Emotional DistressHelp for the BurdenedCamping and the Outdoors: Medicine for the SoulEssay: A Boring Camping Photo--More Than Meets the Eye?Epilogue: The Word "Camping"&nbsp;<b>Chapter 7: Parasites and Worms: The New Lyme Disease Co-Infection?

What is the Best Lyme Treatment?<b>PRAISE FROM BEST-SELLING AUTHOR CONNIE STRASHEIM:</b><br><br>"Freedom From Lyme Disease is an excellent book that provides not only fantastic information about how to heal from Lyme, but also, and more importantly, insights and trouble-shooting tips for overcoming roadblocks to recovery. In this book, Bryan will show you how to overcome difficult challenges such as deeply-entrenched infections, heavy metal toxins, methylation problems, and adrenal fatigue, as well as how to choose among the vast multitude of remedies and therapies to find those that would most benefit you.<br>&nbsp;<br><br>Bryan's insight into the healing process is based not only upon his research and own recovery from Lyme disease, but also upon his innate ability to discern and define the issues and problems inherent in overcoming serious chronic illness. I have seen a lot of information about how to treat Lyme disease, from doctors and patients alike--but information, while it leads to knowledge, does not necessarily lead to the wisdom that empowers recovery. Bryan provides a healthy dose of both wisdom and knowledge in this book, which will help those who are struggling with chronic Lyme to fully heal from this insidious disease. I highly recommend Freedom From Lyme Disease to those who have been fighting the Lyme battle for years, as well as to those who are just getting started out in their healing journey."<br>&nbsp;<br><i>-Connie Strasheim, author of "Beyond Lyme Disease" and "Insights into Lyme Disease Treatment," and co-author of "The Journey to Wellness" series with Dr. W. Lee Cowden</i></p><h2>The Causes of Corruption of the Traditional Text, Vol. 2</h2><p>In this book, Dean Burgon examines fifteen reasons why the Vatican and Sinai manuscripts, which underlie the Westcott and Hort Greek text, corrupted the traditional received text. The Dean Burgon Society believes the traditional received Greek text is the closest to the original manuscripts.</p><p>[This selection is from Chapter 8--Corruption by Heretics.] The Corruptions of the Sacred Text which we have been hitherto considering, however diverse the causes from which they may have resulted, have yet all agreed in this: viz. That they have all been of a lawful nature. My meaning is, that apparently, at no stage of the business has there been 'mala fides' in any quarter. <p>We are prepared to make the utmost allowance for careless, even for licentious transcription; and we can invent excuses for the mistaken zeal, the officiousness if men prefer to call it so, which has occasionally not scrupled to adopt conjectural emendations of the Text. </p><p>To be brief, so long as an honest reason is discoverable for a corrupt reading, we gladly adopt the plea. It has been shewn with sufficient clearness, I trust, in the course of the forgoing chapters, that the number of distinct causes to which various readings may reasonably be attributed is even extraordinary. </p><p>But there remains after all an alarmingly large assortment of textural perturbations which absolutely refuse to fall under any of the heads of classification already enumerated. They are not to be accounted for on any ordinary principle. And this residuum of cases it is, which occasions our present embarrassment. </p><p>They are in truth so exceedingly numerous; they are often so very considerable; they are, as a rule, so very licentious; they transgress to such and extent all regulations; they usurp so persistently the office of truth and faithfulness, that we really know not what to think about them. Sometimes we are presented with gross interpolations,--apocryphal stories: more often with systematic lacerations of the text, or transformations as from an angel of light. </p><p>We are constrained to inquire, How all this can possibly have come about?

Profane literature has never been exposed to such hostility. I make the remark in order also to remind the reader of one more point of [dissimilarity between the two classes of writings.

And to respect it means to accept it for what it is, without &#39;reinterpreting&#39; it and trying to make it what it is not.&#34; His is such a sensible approach that it unlikely to be taken up by our leaders, because to view Islam &#34;as it really is&#34; involves jettisoning illusions upon which our foreign policy has been built for decades. Our leaders suffer from a lack of understanding, a lack of imagination, and a lack of will. They are content to serve as justification for Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s remark that man does not live by bread alone, but chiefly by catchwords. Their thinking is that, with catchwords, we can muddle along-and we can, for a while. The true catch is that, once that while is over, it may be too late to rectify things. -From the Foreword by Karl Keating, President of Catholic Answers</p><p></p><h2>Hard Travel to Sacred Places</h2><p><i>Hard Travel to Sacred Places </i> is the record of a personal odyssey through Southeast Asia, an external and internal journey through grief and the painful realities of a decadent age.

Since the 7.0 magnitude earthquake of January 12, 2010, that struck the island nation, killing more than a quarter-million people and leaving another two million Haitians homeless, Bell has spent much of her time in Haiti. Her new book, <i>Fault Lines</i>, is a searing account of the first year after the earthquake. Bell explores how strong communities and an age-old gift culture have helped Haitians survive in the wake of an unimaginable disaster, one that only compounded the preexisting social and economic distress of their society. The book examines the history that caused such astronomical destruction. It also draws in theories of resistance and social movements to scrutinize grassroots organizing for a more just and equitable country. </p><p><i>Fault Lines</i> offers rich perspectives rarely seen outside Haiti. Readers accompany the author through displaced persons camps, shantytowns, and rural villages, where they get a view that defies the stereotype of Haiti as a lost nation of victims. Street journals impart the author&#x2019;s intimate knowledge of the country, which spans thirty-five years. <i>Fault Lines</i> also combines excerpts of more than one hundred interviews with Haitians, historical and political analysis, and investigative journalism. <i>Fault Lines</i> includes twelve photos from the year following the 2010 earthquake. </p><p>Bell also investigates and critiques U.S. foreign policy, emergency aid, standard development approaches, the role of nongovernmental organizations, and disaster capitalism. Woven through the text are comparisons to the crisis and cultural resistance in Bell&#x2019;s home city of New Orleans, when the levees broke in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Ultimately a tale of hope, <i>Fault Lines</i> will give readers a new understanding of daily life, structural challenges, and collective dreams in one of the world&#x2019;s most complex countries.</p></p><p><p>Beverly Bell is associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and runs the economic and social justice group Other Worlds. Winner of the Outstanding Journalism Award from Women's International Center and the PEN&#x2013;New Mexico Award for Social Justice in Literature, she is the author of <i>Walking on Fire: Haitian Women's Stories of Survival and Resistance</i>, also from Cornell.

These stories of individual Haitians' resistance and commitment, love, and hard work, compel us all to recommit to social justice and change. Whether our focus is rights at work, community organizing, or democracy, this read&#x2015;while at times heartbreaking&#x2015;is in the end inspirational."</p> (Larry Cohen, President, Communications Workers of America)<br><br><p>"<i>Fault Lines</i> is a pathbreaking book. It is very well written and poignant. It is gripping, emotionally rich, and hard to put down. It contains detailed information that will be useful in the classroom and for churches, labor unions, solidarity movements, activists, and aid workers involved in Haiti's recovery from the earthquake. Beverly Bell gives readers an ultimately inspiring account of the disaster from the point of view of the Haitian people."</p> (Mark Schuller, Northern Illinois University, author of <i>Killing with Kindness: Haiti, International Aid, and NGOs</i>)<br><br><p>"In this magnificent book, Beverly Bell has captured the soul and spirit of the Haitian people. She brings their experience with the earthquake to life on the page and makes it clear how much energy and vision they have for the rebuilding of their country and how regularly they are ignored, abused, squelched in their fervent desire to be part of the effort. She castigates the government and private interests whose post-earthquake investments in Haiti are in their own interests and not in the interests of the Haitians."</p> (Ruth Messinger, President, American Jewish World Service)<br><br><p>"The breadth and scope of observation and analysis Beverly Bell offers in<i> Fault Lines</i> is very rare. The length of time she has spent in Haiti, the wide array of experiences she has had there, and the variety of roles she has played both 'on the ground' and from a distance (as a writer and activist in the United States) allow her to provide a level of insight that would be virtually impossible for most observers of Haiti to achieve. The numerous quotations she provides from Haitians themselves are powerful and, again, all too rare in accounts of Haiti."</p> (Jennie Smith-Par�ol�, author of <i>When the Hands Are Many: Community Organization and Social Change in Rural Haiti</i>)<br><br><p>"When I first went to Haiti in 1990, everyone said I couldn't find a better teacher than Beverly Bell. Now, over twenty years later, the same is still true. Bell&#x2019;s firsthand reporting reveals much to readers about Haiti's history and tragic earthquake, but the real takeaway is about the brighter future that social movements are building there. <i>Fault Lines</i> is a must-read for everyone&#x2015;in Haiti or elsewhere&#x2015;who wants to be a part of building that brighter future because, as Bell explains, it is going to take us all."</p> (Annie Leonard, creator, <i>Story of Stuff</i>)</p><h2>Dennis Hopper: Colors, The Polaroids</h2><p><p><strong>Hopper's color Polaroids of LA's gang graffiti</strong></p><p>After losing himself in Taos, New Mexico, for 15 years, Dennis Hopper (1936&#x2013;2010) returned to Los Angeles in the mid-&#x2019;80s. In 1987, on the verge of directing <em>Colors</em>, Hopper made use of a Polaroid camera to document gang graffiti in Los Angeles. He was particularly drawn to the abstract shapes of overlapping paint that appeared when graffiti had been covered up or written over, reminding him, he said, &#x201c;that art is everywhere in every corner that you choose to frame and not just ignore and walk by.&#x201d;</p><p>The Polaroids presented for the first time in this book are proof of that observation. Hopper firmly considered himself an &#x201c;abstract expressionist and action painter by nature, and a Duchampian finger pointer by choice,&#x201d; subscribing wholeheartedly to the idea that &#x201c;the artist of the future will merely point his finger and say it&#x2019;s art--and it will be art.&#x201d;</p><p>In turning the instantaneous, disposable nature of the medium of Polaroid film into pictures as deliberate and final as an image achieved by an artist painting on canvas, these images represent the first part of Hopper&#x2019;s journey back to the world of photography, picking up where he had left off so many years before. This book is in many ways a companion to <em>Drugstore Camera</em> (2015), also edited and designed by Michael Schmelling, which presented Hopper&#x2019;s personal photographs taken in Taos, New Mexico.</p></p><p>Dennis Hopper (1936-2010) was born in Dodge City, Kansas. He first appeared on television in 1954 and quickly became a cult actor, known for films such as Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Easy Rider (1969), The American Friend (1977), Apocalypse Now (1979), Blue Velvet (1986) and Hoosiers (1986). In 1988, he directed the critically acclaimed Colors. Hopper was also a prolific photographer and published now-classic portraits of celebrities such as Andy Warhol and Martin Luther King, Jr. His works are housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others....his thoughtful Polaroid work in color for the first time ever.

The book charts the evolution of the asylum through four incarnations: the eighteenth-century madhouse, the nineteenth century asylum, the twentieth-century mental hospital, and the post-asylum modern day, when mental health has become the concern of the wider community. The book reveals the role that the history of madness and its treatment has played in creating the landscape of the asylum, in all its iterations.</p><p>Moving and sometimes provocative illustrations sourced from the Wellcome Collection's extensive archives and the Bethlem Royal Hospital's archive highlight the trajectory of each successive era of institution: founded in the optimistic spirit of humanitarian reform but eventually dismantled amid accusations of cruelty and neglect. Each chapter concludes with a selection of revealing and captivating artwork created by some of the inmates of the institutions of that era.</p><p><em>This Way Madness Lies</em> highlights fundamental questions that remain relevant and unresolved: What lies at the root of mental illness?

In these moments we not only witness the reversibility of "success," of prominence, but also come to visceral terms with our own vulnerable selves. We can't stop watching the scene of shame, identifying with it and absorbing its nearness, and relishing our imagined immunity from its stain, even as we acknowledge the universal, embarrassing predicament of living in our own bodies. With an unusual, disarming blend of autobiography and cultural commentary, noted poet and critic Wayne Koestenbaum takes us through a spectrum of mortifying circumstances&#x2015;in history, literature, art, current events, music, film, and his own life. His generous disclosures and brilliant observations go beyond prurience to create a poetics of abasement. Inventive, poignant, erudite, and playful, <i>Humiliation </i>plunges into one of the most disquieting of human experiences, with reflections at once emboldening and humane.</p></p><p><p><b>WAYNE KOESTENBAUM </b>has published five books of poetry, one novel, and six books of nonfiction.

The arraigned man said, &#x201c;I was put into a cage and told to take off my clothes.&#x201d; He was ordered&#x2014;according to <i>The New York Times&#x2014;</i>&#x201c;to squat and spread his buttocks.&#x201d; The accused, who&#x2019;d been arrested for possession of marijuana, described the strip search as &#x201c;horrifying&#x201d;: &#x201c;Being a grown man, I was humiliated.&#x201d;<br><i>2.</i><br>&#x201c;Humiliation&#x201d; means &#x201c;to be made humble.&#x201d; To be made human? &#x201c;Human&#x201d; and &#x201c;humiliation&#x201d; do not share an etymological root, but even in Latin the two words&#x2014;<i>humanus</i> and <i>humiliatio&#x2014;</i>suggestively share a prefix.<br><i>3.</i><br>Repeatedly I watch clips of Liza Minnelli on YouTube. I want to see her humiliation. And I want to see her survive the grisly experience and turn it into glory.<br><i>4.</i><br>Being humiliated is an experience, I presume, that you don&#x2019;t want&#x2014;unless you&#x2019;re a masochist. And then your humiliation isn&#x2019;t dire. It&#x2019;s pleasure. Humiliation, if passed through the masochistic centrifuge, becomes joy, or uplift&#x2014;all emotional dissonances resolved.<br><i>5.</i><br>An oft-repeated legend: the writer Colette was locked in her room by her husband, Willy, so that she&#x2019;d be forced to produce her Claudine novels. Need I humiliate myself to write this book?<br><i>6.</i><br>Michael Jackson&#x2019;s father beat him; MGM fed &#x201c;uppers&#x201d; to Judy Garland. The performer must be coerced or brutalized to perform. &#x201c;Beat It&#x201d; and &#x201c;Over the Rainbow&#x201d; reverse the humiliation, or continue it.<br><i>7.</i><br>Performers spawn performers, an intergenerational saga of distress. Liza (in the eyes of a shame-hungry public) is humiliated by inability to reach her mother&#x2019;s pinnacle, or by inability to reach her own former pinnacle. Past triumphs rise up to humiliate the present self.<br><i>8.</i><br>To prove that humiliation exists, we don&#x2019;t need to hear from witnesses. Everyone has been humiliated, although the texture of each person&#x2019;s experience differs&#x2014;like Tolstoy&#x2019;s unhappy families, each unhappy in its own way.<br><i>9.</i><br>Imagine a society in which humiliation is essential&#x2014;as a rite of passage, as a passport to decency and civilization, as a necessary shedding of hubris.<br><i>10.</i><br>Any writer&#x2019;s humiliation I take personally. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want poets to be humiliated,&#x201d; writes poet Ruth Padel, about the smear campaign against rival Derek Walcott, accused of sexual harassment. But then the press revealed that she&#x2019;d helped spread the bad word about Walcott, and she, in turn, was disgraced. Retelling this story, I wince: I&#x2019;m tainted by the news I leak.<br><i>11.</i><br>According to feminist Mary Daly (quoted in Adrienne Rich&#x2019;s <i>Of Woman Born</i>), &#x201c;Many would see abortion as a humiliating procedure.&#x201d; Many would see insemination as a humiliating procedure. Many would see death as a humiliating procedure. Many would see literacy as a humiliating procedure.<br><i>12.</i><br>I approach this vast subject from a limited angle&#x2014;the angle of fatigue. I am tired, as any human must be, after a life spent avoiding humiliation and yet standing near its flame, enjoying the sparks, the heat, the paradoxical illumination.<br><i>13.</i><br>Not merely because I am tired, but because this subject, humiliation, is monstrous, and because it erodes the voice that tries to lay siege to its complexities, I will resign myself, in the fugues that follow, to setting forth an open-ended series of paradoxes and juxtapositions. (I call these excursions &#x201c;fugues&#x201d; not only because I want the rhetorical license offered by invoking counterpoint but because a &#x201c;fugue state&#x201d; is a mentally unbalanced condition of dissociated wandering away from one&#x2019;s own identity.) Some of my fugal juxtapositions are literal and logical, while others are figurative, meant merely to suggest the presence of undercurrents, sympathies, resonances shared between essentially <i>unlike</i> experiences. If there is any reward to be found in this exercise of juxtaposing contraries to detect the occasional gleam of likeness, that dividend lies in the apprehension of a singular prey: the detection of a whimpering beast inside each of us, a beast whose cries are micropitches, too faint for regular notation.<br><i>14.</i><br>When I see a public figure humiliated, I feel empathy. I imagine: <i>that martyr could be me.</i> Even if the public figure did something wrong, I empathize. Even if Michael Jackson slept with children. Even if Roman Polanski raped a thirteen-year-old. When I see the famous figure brought to trial, even if only trial-by-media, <i>especially if the crime is sexual,</i> I&#x2019;m seized by horror and fascination, by pity, by terror: here again, as if at the Acropolis or the Roman Colosseum, I see the dramatic onset of a familiar scene, an unveiling, a goring, a staining, a stripping away of privilege.<br><i>15.</i><br>Speaking, I&#x2019;m on display&#x2014;a pornographic exhibit. I&#x2019;m a centerfold, my legs spread. If someone sees my nude photo on the Internet, then I&#x2019;m humiliated, or else that Web trawler, finding my photo, is humiliated on my behalf.<br><i>16.</i><br>When I found a student&#x2019;s nude photo on the Web, and when I jerked off to that photo (I could be making up this fact), I worried that I&#x2019;d humiliated him. Or perhaps I&#x2019;m humiliating the student by telling you this story now. Lest you wish to prosecute me for my fantasies, please know that the student was in his late twenties and was advertising his sexual services. In the photo, he smiled with what seemed authentic gladness.<br><i>17.</i><br>After a fight, an eighteen-year-old boy in Florida sends a nude photograph of his underage girlfriend (she is sixteen) to &#x201c;dozens of people, including her parents,&#x201d; according to <i>The New York Times,</i> whose pages I cruise for humiliation. By clipping the news stories, I become a guilty party.<br><i>18.</i><br>Sexuality, in any of its guises and positions, is potentially humiliating. At least the Transcendental feminist Margaret Fuller thought so. Elizabeth Hardwick, who wrote eloquently about seduced women, quotes a telling passage: when Fuller&#x2019;s boyfriend or husband forced her to have sex, she experienced &#x201c;what was to every worthy and womanly feeling so humiliating.&#x201d; And in Harriet Jacobs&#x2019;s now-canonical <i>Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl: Written by Herself,</i> the writer reserves the word &#x201c;humiliation&#x201d; for instances of <i>sexual</i> degradation. The fact of being enslaved she doesn&#x2019;t refer to as humiliating. What is humiliating is the sexual body itself, its humors and swellings, its pulsations and emissions. Theorist Julia Kristeva uses the word &#x201c;abject&#x201d; to describe this fetid, wet, organ-centered process.<br><i>19.</i><br>The Marquis de Sade piles up humiliations, and I aim to do the same. The pleasure some of us get from watching TV or appearing on TV, or the pleasure some of us get from porn, or the pleasure some of us get from disliking sexual criminals&#x2014;the pleasure (or call it an emotion more complex than pleasure) some of us get from spectacles of all kinds is connected to what transpires in the torture room.<br><i>20.</i><br>The Abu Ghraib photos made torture topical. A U.S. Army reservist&#x2014;Lynndie England, joined by leering peers&#x2014;posed beside a &#x201c;pyramid&#x201d; of stripped Iraqi men; humiliating them, she turned herself into an internationally maligned object.

Vora examines how forms of labor serve to support life in the United States at the expense of the lives of people in India.

Human bodies and subjects are playing a role similar to that of land and natural resource dispossession in the period of capitalist growth during European territorial colonialism.

After their previous field trips, the children in Ms. Frizzle's class are all blase about such things; as they land on the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and fly by the other planets and the Sun, they comment on what they see, generate a blizzard of one- or two-sentence reports on special topics and--even while Ms. Frizzle is temporarily left behind in the asteroid belt--crack terrible jokes ("Could Saturn take a bath? Yes, but it might leave a ring!"). Although some of the information is radically simplified--people are said to float in space because "without a large mass nearby . . . they do not have weight"--Cole keeps the narrative specific without burdening it with loads of facts.

Buildings contribute to a changing climate and warming of the earth in ways that will significantly affect future generations. Zero net energy (ZNE) buildings are a practical and cost-effective way to reduce our energy needs, employ clean solar and wind technologies, protect the environment, and improve our lives. Interest in ZNE buildings, which produce as much energy as they use over the course of a year, has been growing rapidly.<br><br> In the <i>Design Professional&#x2019;s Guide to Zero Net Energy Buildings</i>, Charles Eley draws from over 40 years of his own experience, and interviews with other industry experts, to lay out the principles for achieving ZNE buildings and the issues surrounding their development. Eley emphasizes the importance of building energy use in achieving a sustainable future; describes how building energy use can be minimized through smart design and energy efficiency technologies; and presents practical information on how to incorporate renewable energy technologies to meet the lowered energy needs. The book identifies the building types and climates where meeting the goal will be a challenge and offers solutions for these special cases. It shows the reader, through examples and explanations, that these solutions are viable and cost-effective.<br><br> ZNE buildings are practical and cost-effective ways to address climate change without compromising our quality of life. ZNE buildings are an energizing concept and one that is broadly accepted yet, there is little information on what is required to actually meet these goals. This book shows that the goal is feasible and can be practically achieved in most buildings, that our construction industry is up to the challenge, and that we already have the necessary technologies and knowledge.</p><p>A practical, accessible guide to the principles of developing zero net energy buildings.&nbsp;<br>Charles Eley is an architect and mechanical engineer experienced in energy-efficient and sustainable design. He has advised in the design of many pioneering energy efficient buildings and has made significant contributions to the California energy standards, ASHRAE Standard 90.1, and other international standards and programs.

All data that could be found in the files of the War and Navy Departments, the State Archives and Land Office, the County Court order books of the period, early and accredited histories, and scores of miscellaneous sources are included. The men are listed alphabetically by surname, with references to the documents in which evidence of service is found. In the case of officers, for example, the material is remarkably complete. It has been possible to establish the dates of their commissions, when they took their oaths of allegiance, their promotions, citations for gallantry, deaths, and amounts of bounty land awarded them.

MacGregor Mathers from ancient manuscripts in the British museums. Included by Mathers is the Order of the Pentacles of Solomon, the Ancient Fragment of the Key of Solomon, The Qabalistic Invocation of Solomon, and 15 plates full of figures, seals and charts, as well as the original text giving detailed instruction for spells and invocations.</p> <p>The work is traditionally divided into two books detailing the Key of King Solomon. Book One explains the operation of conjurations, curses, spells and other magical works. Book Two instructs the practitioner on the proper attire, purification rituals and other means of obtaining the goals of the Goetia. Between these two books is the list of plates that contain numerous illustrations and secret seals of Solomon, including the Mystical Seal of Solomon, the Pentacles of Solomon, and the Mystical Alphabet, which impart the mechanisms and requirements for the invocation of spirits and demons.</p> <p>The Lesser Key of Solomon, or the Clavicula Salomonis Regis, or Lemegeton, is a compilation of materials and writings from ancient sources making up a text book of magic or &#x201c;grimoire.&#x201d; Portions of this book can be traced back to the mid-16th to 17th centuries, when occult researchers such as Cornelius Agrippa and Johannes Trithemisus assembled what they discovered during their investigations into their own great works.</p> <p>As a modern grimoire, the Lesser Key of Solomon has seen several editions with various authors and editors taking liberty to edit and translate the ancient writings and source material. In 1898, Arthur Edward Waite published his The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts, which contained large portions of the Lemegeton. He was followed by Mathers and Crowley in 1904 who published The Goetia: The Lesser Key of Solomon. Many others have assembled their own version of this ancient material since, and it is important to realize that it is the contents rather than the book itself that make up the Lesser Key. Traditionally, the source material is divided into five books: Ars Goetia, Ars Theurgia Goetia, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel, and Ars Notoria. Mathers and Crowley indicate their edition is a translation of the first.</p> <p>In the preface to this edition, it is explained that a &#x201c;Secret Chief&#x201d; of the Rosicrucian Order directed the completion of the book. The original editor was a G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F. who translated ancient texts from French, Hebrew, and Latin, but was unable to complete his labors because of the martial assaults of the Four Great Princes. Crowley was then asked to step in and finish what the previous author had begun. Traditionally, S. L. MacGregor Mathers is credited as the translator of this edition, and Crowley is given the title of editor.</p> <p>Scholars believe these books of Solomon and their many iterations derive from the ancient practices of Jewish Kabbalah and Arab Alchemy. After time, it is thought Greek and Roman influences were added until, finally, the work was used and molded by high Renaissance magicians. This book, as well as other King Solomon books, such as the Magical Treatise of King Solomon and the Testament of Solomon, were brought back to modern times through the labors of occult practitioners such as S. L. MacGregor Mathers, Aleister Crowley and others around the turn of the last century.</p></p><p><p>Aleister Crowley born Edward Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 &#x2013; 1 December 1947, was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, poet, painter, novelist, and mountaineer. He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the �on of Horus in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.</p> <p>Born to a wealthy Plymouth Brethren family in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Crowley rejected this fundamentalist Christian faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism. He was educated at the University of Cambridge, where he focused his attentions on mountaineering and poetry, resulting in several publications. In 1898 he joined the esoteric Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers and Allan Bennett.</p> <p>Samuel Liddell (or Liddel) MacGregor Mathers, born Samuel Liddell Mathers, was a British occultist. He is primarily known as one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a ceremonial magic order of which offshoots still exist today.</p> <p>Mathers was born in January 1854 in Hackney, London, England. He attended Bedford School, subsequently working in Bournemouth, Dorset, as a clerk.</p> <p>Mathers was a polyglot; among the languages he had studied were English, French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Gaelic and Coptic, though he had a greater command of some languages than of others. His translations of such books as The Book of Abramelin (14thC.), Christian Knorr von Rosenroth's The Kabbalah Unveiled (1684), Key of Solomon (anonymous 14thC.), The Lesser Key of Solomon (anonymous 17thC.), and the Grimoire of Armadel (17thC.), while probably justly criticized with respect to quality, were responsible for making what had been obscure and inaccessible material widely available to the non-academic English speaking world.</p> <p>Mathers died in November 1918 aged 64.</p></p><h2>X-O Manowar (2017) Volume 6: Agent</h2><p>The Agents of G.A.T.E. vs. the Brothers of the Bomb!<br> <br> Beyond time, space, and reality, there lies the Unknown...and now it&#x2019;s coming here!

K. Chesterton</h2><p>This is a collection of quotes selected by Chesterton himself from material the ever--popular Chesterton wrote between 1901 and 1911. Editorial comments have been added to explain details dimmed by the passage of time. A bibliography describes the sources used, and a detailed, 17-page index helps readers locate specific topics and quotes.</p><p>For any author, much less a 'rolicking' journalist often caught up in the passing controversies of his day, the writings of G. K. Chesterton have shown remarkable staying power. During his life, this talented British writer was the private friend and public foe of writers such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. Two-thirds of a century after his death, the ideas of Shaw and Wells seem curiously quaint and dated, while Chesterton's writings remain fresh as the day they were written. That's why many of Wells later and more political writings are out of print while more and more of what Chesterton wrote is finding its way back onto the shelves of bookstores. <p>The reason simple. Chesterton is one of the most quotable writers of the twentieth-century. He has an incredible knack for capturing in a few concise and memorable words what other authors labor and groan to say over many pages. Lengthy books have been written to explain the essence of Fascism and its close kin Nazism. Few have come as close as Chesterton did when he remarked that, "The intellectual criticism of Fascism is really this: that it appeals to an appetite for authority, without very clearly giving the authority for the appetite." That is Hitler's "Fuhrer Principle" in a nutshell, and why so many followed the German dictator into madness.</p>Here are some samples from the book: <p>The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried. (January 13) </p><p>Darwinism can be used to back up two mad moralities, but it cannot be used to back up a single sane one. The kinship and competition of all living creatures can be used as a reason for being insanely cruel or insanely sentimental; but not for a healthy love of animals. (January 22) </p><p>Modesty has moved from the organ of ambition. Modesty has settled upon the organ of conviction where it was never meant to be. A man was meant to be doubtful about himself, but undoubting about the truth: this has been exactly reversed. . . The old humility was a spur that prevented a man from stopping: not a nail in his boot that prevented him from going on. For the old humility made a man doubtful about his efforts, which might make him work harder. But the new humility makes a man doubtful about his aims, which will make him stop working altogether. (April 2) </p><p>It is not by any means self-evident upon the face of it that an institution like the liberty of speech is right or just. It is not natural or obvious to let a man utter follies and abominations which you believe to be bad for mankind any more than it is natural or obvious to let a man dig up a part of the public road, or infect half a town with typhoid fever. The theory of free speech, that truth is so much larger and stranger and more many-sided than we know of, that it is very much better at all costs to hear every one's account of it, is a theory which has been justified upon the whole by experiment, but which remains a very daring and even a very surprising theory. It is really one of the great discoveries of the modern time; but once admitted, it is a principle that does not merely affect politics, but philosophy, ethics, and finally, poetry. (May 9) </p><p>It was Huxley and Herbert Spencer and Bradlaugh who brought me back to orthodox theology. They sowed in my mind my first wild doubts of doubt. Our grandmothers were quite right when they said that Tom Paine and the Freethinkers unsettled the mind. They do. They unsettled mine horribly. The rationalists made me question whether reason was of any use whatever; and when I had finished Herbert Spencer I had got as far as doubting (for the first time) whether evolution had occurred at all. As I laid down the last of Colonel Ingersoll's atheistic lectures, the dreadful thought broke into my mind, 'Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.' (December 21)</p></p><h2>O&#39;Neil Ford, Architect (Volume 1) (Sara and John Lindsey Series in the Arts and Humanities)</h2><p>Himself designated a National Historical Landmark by the National Council on the Arts, O'Neil Ford with his associates designed some of the most famous architectural landmarks in Texas and elsewhere in the nation: the Texas Instruments Semiconductor Building in Dallas, the Little Chapel in the Woods at Texas Woman's University, campuses of the University of Texas at San Antonio, Skidmore College in New York, and Trinity University, San Antonio. The list of credits goes on and on for this remarkable architect who brought an indigenous Southwestern flair to homes, public buildings, and businesses.<br><br>From the mid-1930s until his death in 1982, Ford was a pied piper for young architects, and the message he piped was always the same: sensitivity to the nature of materials the earth provided; concern for timelessness and the performance of a building over the long haul; adaptability to changing needs; and innovative approaches to budgetary constraints. In short, he advocated and practiced the building of structures that are expressions of something real and lasting. With 36 full-color photographs and 124 black-and-white pictures, this volumes lavishly illustrates his vision and his legacy.<br><br>O'Neil Ford was controversial, paradoxical, contradictory. No one who knew him or his work was lukewarm about him. Nor was he lukewarm about others. In his world there were only heroes and villains; the villains were the vulgarians. Ford, long considered a leader of the Modern movement in the Southwest, was grieved by the concept of architecture as a product of superficial fashion with current "vocabularies" and design by stylish formulae. Now, in the "post-Post-Modern" epoch, his words again ring fresh and true, and his culturally well-grounded architecture inspires anew.<br><br>Through extensive interviews with Ford and scores of others and using Ford's diaries (1951-82), Mary Carolyn Hollers George has traced Ford's life and work, as well as the cast of characters who peopled his world. His close, and eventually prominent, friends contributed immensely not only to his own development but to the artistic milieu of a budding Southwestern regionalism. Also part of the mix were the young architects who flowed through Ford's office, being inculcated with his ways of of dealing with materials and his belief in the unity of structural and architectural forms, and who are still influencing the design understandings of today.</p><p>Mary Carolyn Hollers George is associate professor of the history of art at San Antonio College. Holding a bachelor&#39;s degree from Mary Baldwin College and a master&#39;s from the University of Texas at Austin, she is a member of the Society of Architectural Historians and the author of two previous books.&#34;The greatest value of George&#39;s book is its copiously detailed look at his earliest years and formative influences. . . . George offers some spendid background material on the architect&#39;s work with the new lift-slab technique developed by San Antonian Tom Slick; and the space-frame floor and hyperbolic paraboloid concrete canopy of the Texas Instruments semiconductor building in Dallas, engineered by Felix Candela.&#34;--Mike Greenberg (Mike Greenberg)</p><h2>The Meccan Revelations, volume I</h2><p>Perhaps no mystic in the history of the world has delved as deeply into the inner knowledge that informs our being as did Ibn 'Arabi. He was born into the cultural and religious crucible of Andalusian Spain in 1165, a place and time in which Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars learned from each other and from the Greek classics that were then being translated and circulated. Drawing from the most advanced philosophical and metaphysical thinking of his time and from his extensive knowledge of the religion of Islam, Ibn 'Arabi created an extraordinary mystical theology that essentially sprang from his own spiritual realization. Because of the advanced nature of his teachings he has been known for 800 years as the Sheikh al-Akbar, or the Greatest Master. <p>Because of the subtlety of his language and complexity of his thought, access to Ibn 'Arabi has always been difficult and translation daunting. Previously only short extracts were available in English. This volume, the first in our English translation of Les Illuminations de la Mecque, contains 22 key chapters of this Sufi 'summa mystica,' on such issues as Ibn 'Arabi's doctrine of the Divine Names, the nature of spiritual experience, the end of time, the resurrection and the stages of the path that lead to sanctity. </p><p>This great book soars beyond time, culture and any particular form of religion. Describing what is fundamental to our humanity, it is astonishingly universal. Finally readers in the West have an entree into one of the most important, profound works of world literature.</p></p><p>'Suddenly, one of the most... inaccessible of the great Sufis has emerged into the limelight of Islamic history with amazing swiftness and an impact no one was prepared to experience.... In these days, when the image of Islam provided by modernist and fundamentalist Muslims seem so superficial and uninspiring, it is good to hear from such great traditional authorities as Ibn 'Arabi, whose ideas seem always fresh and deep. <p>Victor Danner, author of The Islamic Tradition</p>Shaykh Muhyiddin Ibn al &#39;Arabi (13th Century) was called the &#34;Greatest Shaykh,&#34; the consummate master of Islamic mysticism (Sufism).</p><h2>The Liars&#39; Gospel: A Novel</h2><p><strong>"A visceral retelling of the events surrounding the life of Jesus....The ferocity of Barabbas and Judas seizes the narrative and occupies its center ground." <br>--- Hilary Mantel</strong> <br><br>A year after the death of Yehoshuah, a mysterious figure who wandered Roman-occupied Judea giving sermons and healing the sick, four people tell their stories.<br><br>A mother, a friend, a collaborator, a rebel-to each of these witnesses the young preacher represents strikingly different things. But whether the witnesses are lying or telling the truth, their accounts will change all that comes after.<br><br>This is a story of sacrifice and betrayal, oppression and resistance, and the courage it takes to make both war and peace.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982.

To think that a million people could decide to read something written in the solitude of a room, with only the twenty-eight letters of the Spanish alphabet and two fingers as the entire arsenal, seemed madness from every point of view. Today, the Academies of the Language have published this edition as a gesture towards a novel that has passed before the eyes of fifty times a million readers, and towards an insomniac artisan like me, who cannot leave behind his surprise at everything that has happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this is not and cannot be a matter of honouring a writer. This miracle is the irrefutable demonstration that there are an enormous number of people prepared to read stories in the Spanish language, and therefore a million copies of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> are not a million tributes to the writer who blushes as he receives today the first book of this print run. It is proof that there are millions of readers of texts in the Spanish language waiting for this nourishment.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing has changed since then in my writing routine. I have never seen anything other than my two index fingers striking one by one and at a brisk pace the twenty-eight letters of the unmodified alphabet that I&#x2019;ve had before my eyes for more than seventy years. Today, it was incumbent upon me to lift my head and attend this tribute, for which I am grateful, and all I can do is stop and think about what it is that has happened. What I see is that the non-existent reader of my blank page is today an immense crowd hungry to read texts in Spanish.<br> &nbsp;<br> The readers of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> are a community who, if they lived on the same piece of ground, would be one of the twenty most populous countries in the world. This isn&#x2019;t a boastful statement. Just the opposite. I simply want to show that there are a number of human beings who have demonstrated with their habit of reading that their souls are open to be filled with messages in Spanish. The challenge for all writers, all the poets, narrators, and educators in&nbsp; our language, is to quench that thirst and increase that crowd, the real <i>raison d&#x2019;etre</i> of our craft and, of course, ourselves.<br> &nbsp;<br> When I was thirty-eight, having already published four books since my twenties, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote: &#x201c;Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendia was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.&#x201d; I had no idea of the significance or the origin of that sentence, or of where it would lead me. What I know today is that for eighteen months I didn&#x2019;t stop writing for a single day until I finished the book.<br> &nbsp;<br> It may seem untrue, but one of my most pressing problems was typewriter paper. I was ignorant enough to think that mistakes in typing, language, or grammar were actually creative errors, and whenever I found them I tore up the page and tossed it in the wastepaper basket to start again. With the rhythm I had acquired in a year of practice, I calculated it would take me six months of daily mornings to finish the book.<br> &nbsp;<br> Esperanza Araiza, the unforgettable Pera, the typist for poets and filmmakers, had typed fair copies of great works by Mexican writers. Among them, Carlos Fuentes&#x2019; <i>Where the Air is Clear,</i> Juan Rulfo&#x2019;s <i>Pedro Paramo</i>, and several original scripts by Don Luis Bunuel. When I proposed that she type up the final version, the novel was a rough draft riddled with corrections, first in black ink and then in red to avoid confusion. But that was nothing for a woman accustomed to everything in a lion&#x2019;s cage. Years later, Pera confessed that, as she was taking home the final version that I had corrected, she slipped as she got off the bus in torrential rain, and the pages were left floating in the quagmire of the street. She gathered them, soaking wet and almost illegible, with the help of other passengers, and dried them in her house, page by page, with an iron.<br> &nbsp;<br> What could have been the inspiration for another, better book was how Mercedes and I survived with our two sons during that time when I didn&#x2019;t earn a penny anywhere. I don&#x2019;t even know how Mercedes managed to have food in the house every day during those months. We had resisted the temptation of loans with interest until we tied up our hearts and made our first incursions into the pawnshop.<br> &nbsp;<br> After the short-lived relief afforded by certain small things, we had to turn to the jewelry that Mercedes had received from her family over the years. The expert examined them with the rigor of a surgeon, inspected and checked again with his magical eye the diamonds in the earrings, the emeralds in the necklace, the rubies in the rings, and finally returned them to us with the long <i>veronica</i> of a bullfighter: &#x201c;All of this is nothing but glass.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the moments of greatest difficulty, Mercedes made her astral calculations and told the patient landlord, without the slightest tremor in her voice: &#x201c;We can pay you the full amount in six months.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Excuse me, senora,&#x201d; the owner replied, &#x201c;but do you realize that by then it will be an enormous amount?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I do realize that,&#x201d; said an impassive Mercedes, &#x201c;but by then we&#x2019;ll have everything resolved. Don&#x2019;t worry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And when she responded to the good lawyer who was a highly placed state official and one of the most elegant and patient men we had ever met, again her voice didn&#x2019;t tremble.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Very well, senora, your word is good enough for me,&#x201d; and he made his fatal calculations. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll expect you on September 7.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At last, at the beginning of August 1966, Mercedes and I went to the post office in Mexico City to send to Buenos Aires the finished version of <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i>, a package containing 590 pages typed doubled spaced on ordinary paper, and addressed to Francisco Porrua, literary director of Editorial Sudamericana.<br> &nbsp;<br> The post-office clerk placed the package on the scale, made his mental calculations, and said: &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be eighty-two pesos.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mercedes counted the notes and loose change remaining in her purse and confronted reality: &#x201c;We have only fifty-three.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> We opened the package, divided it in half, and sent one to Buenos Aires without even asking ourselves how we would get the money to post the rest. Only afterwards did we realize we hadn&#x2019;t sent the first half but the second. But before we got hold of the money to mail it, Paco Porrua, our man in Editorial Sudamericana, anxious to read the first half of the book, forwarded us the money so that we could send it to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was how we were reborn into our new life of today.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Alchemical Medicine for the 21st Century: Spagyrics for Detox, Healing, and Longevity</h2><p>Using the ancient art of spagyrics for treatment of today&#x2019;s health problems <br> <br>� Contains detailed indications for using alchemical preparations therapeutically <br> <br>� Shows how the essences work holistically to heal the mind, body, and spirit with the energetic qualities of the plant <br> <br>� Provides effective therapy for a wide range of physical and mental disorders <br> <br>Spagyrics is a branch of medicinal alchemy that enhances the healing properties already existing in plants.

The preparation of this alchemical medicine makes it possible to capture the full therapeutic spectrum of plants, including the cosmic energies they have absorbed. <br> <br><em>Alchemical Medicine for the 21st Century</em> contains detailed indications for using these alchemical preparations to treat both physical and mental disorders. The author shows, for example, that the tincture made from dandelion is especially potent on liver-related ailments and also raises the spirit and frees the patient from anger and bitterness. The immune system is also boosted by this essence, providing tonic effects for allergy sufferers. The author, a homeopath since 2000, also shows how these spagyric essences can be potentized homeopathically. <br> <br>CLARE GOODRICK-CLARKE is a homeopath and honorary fellow of the University of Exeter, where she lectures on the esoteric body and the history of alchemy. She studied with Manfred M. Junius, author of <em>Spagyrics</em>, and she is the author of <em>The Hermetic Art of Alchemy</em> and coauthor (with Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke) of <em>G.R.S.

Esslemont</b></p><p>The return of the mercenary company, the Crimson Guard, could not have come at a worse time for a Malazan Empire exhausted by warfare and weakened by betrayals and rivalries. Indeed, there are those who wonder whether the Empress Laseen might not be losing her grip on power as she faces increasing unrest as conquered kingdoms and principalities sense freedom once more.</p><p>Into the seething cauldron of Quon Tali--the Empire's heartland--marches the Guard. With their return comes the memory of the Empire--and yet all is not well with the Guard itself. Elements within its elite, the Avowed, have set their sights on far greater power. There are ancient entities who also seek to further their own arcane ends. And what of the swordsman called Traveller who, with his companion Ereko, has gone in search of a confrontation from which none have ever returned?</p><p>As the Guard prepares to wage war, so Laseen's own generals and mages, the 'Old Hands', grow impatient at what they see as her mismanagement of the Empire. But could Laseen have outwitted them all? Could she be using the uprisings to draw out and finally eliminate these last irksome survivors from the days of her illustrious predecesor, Kellanved?</p></p><p><p>IAN CAMERON ESSLEMONT grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He has studied archaeology and creative writing, has traveled extensively in South-East Asia, and lived in Thailand and Japan for several years. He now lives in Alaska with his wife and children and is currently working on another novel set in the world of Malaz, a world he co-created with his friend Steven Erikson.</p>Starred Review. Nearly 100 years ago, the Crimson Guard vowed they would not die until they destroyed the Malazan Empire. In this riveting sequel to 2009's <i>Night of Knives</i>, the time has come for that vow to be fulfilled. The empire has been stretched too far, too thin. Empress Laseen is boxed up in Unta, the imperial capital, while the conquered and the conquerors clash on the Seti Plains. At last the call comes for the Crimson Guard to re-form and add their undying forces to the melee. In a long, bloody, explosive-filled battle to end all battles, Esslemont handily outdoes series cocreator Steven Erikson, evoking the gore and grit of the battlefield while cannily expanding the labyrinthine Malazan world and untangling the wickedly intertwined stories just enough to keep readers from feeling lost. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Niels Hemmingsen (1513&#x2013;1600), the &#x201c;Teacher of Denmark,&#x201d; was a Danish humanist and theologian who studied with the &#x201c;Teacher of Germany,&#x201d; Philip Melanchthon, at the University of Wittenberg. Hemmingsen went on to serve as a professor at the University of Copenhagen&#x2014;first of Greek, then of dialectic, and finally of theology. He wrote voluminously on method, theology, exegesis, homiletics, and ethics.In this treatise Hemmingsen argues that all particular rules of ethical conduct can be derived from immutable axioms or first principles. Though moral philosophy works according to its own rules, Hemmingsen shows that its conclusions, far from being at odds with the divine revelation of the moral law, are identical with the ethical commandments of Scripture. Thus Hemmingsen includes a section on the Decalogue, along with a lengthy account of the traditional cardinal virtues, supported by a myriad of quotations from classical Greek and Roman sources. This important treatise looks both backward to classical and medieval philosophy and forward to developments in the seventeenth century and beyond.</p><p></p><h2>The Way Home: Reflections on American Beauty</h2><p>Jeffrey Bilhuber offers a look into intimate rooms fitting for today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeffrey Bilhuber, the decorator of choice for the creative elite-including fashion editors, designers, and musicians-presents his most recent projects, all of which exemplify the hallmarks of his inimitable style: flashpoints of inspiration from the past that embrace tradition while being rooted in the way we live today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Perhaps like no other contemporary decorator, Bilhuber has been a barometer of change, and this book marks a new, more relaxed evolution of his style.

The diner&#x2019;s windows were frosty and gave the feeling that everyone was inside a cozy cocoon.</p><p>As I was refilling my mug behind the counter, I paused to listen to the chatter of my customers and the clatter of silverware on plates&#x2014;another one of my favorite things.</p><p>The smell of bacon frying and bread toasting permeated the air along with the strong aroma of coffee brewing. Mmm&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Arriving customers shrugged out of their winter regalia and helped their children out of theirs. They stuffed mittens, hats, and whatnot into the pockets of their coats and hung them on the pegs near the front door. If they were lucky enough to find a red vinyl booth right off the bat, they shuffled over to claim it as their own by hanging everything on the brass treble hooks screwed into the frame.</p><p>Heads were hunched over my big plastic menus, and fingers were pointing to the colorful pictures as my morning-shift waitress walked around with pots of coffee&#x2014;regular and decaf&#x2014;and exchanged friendly banter.</p><p>Because Sandy Harbor was such a small village, most everyone knew one another. Joking, shouting, and table hopping were common, much to the confusion of my waitresses. But that was the way of it here. There were plans being made for ice fishing, shopping trips to Syracuse or Watertown for clothing and after-Christmas sales, and a rather in-depth discussion about dairy cows and where to buy hay if there was a shortage.</p><p>And as always, weather was a big topic. I tuned in to a conversation between Guy Eastman, who owned a zillion cows and grew the best butter and sugar corn during the summer season, and Dave Cross, who was our area plumber and fishing guide.</p><p>Dave stirred his coffee absentmindedly. &#x201c;My bunions tell me that we are going to have one hell of a blizzard. And that it&#x2019;s going to be bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My right elbow was aching this morning, so I think you&#x2019;re right, but my left knee was calm, so you might be wrong,&#x201d; replied Guy. &#x201c;My hammertoe was throbbing, and so was this blister I got from my new work boots. I wonder if that means anything.&#x201d;</p><p>Dave shrugged. &#x201c;My right knee was creaking this morning. That&#x2019;s usually a sign of frost, but we&#x2019;re beyond frost. Maybe it&#x2019;s warning me about more sleet coming.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Creaking? Both of my knees were creaking when I walked in here&#x2014;it&#x2019;s my bursitis and arthritis. Oh, and I had pain shooting up and down my right leg. That tells me we&#x2019;re in for a couple feet of snow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, Guy!&#x201d; Dave exclaimed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a snow predictor; that&#x2019;s your sciatica.&#x201d;</p><p>A big laugh started in my stomach, and it was just about to make its way to the surface. I was in trouble. I had just taken a big gulp of coffee, and I was going to spray it all over my pretty diner if I couldn&#x2019;t swallow both the coffee and the laugh at the same time. Leaning over, I opened one of the cooler doors below the counter and made like I was looking for something until I could tamp down the laugh and the liquid.</p><p>These were the sights, sounds, and smells of my diner this Sunday morning in January. And I could think of nothing better in this world.</p><p>But both Guy and Dave were right, according to our local weatherperson, Heather &#x201c;Flip a Coin&#x201d; Flipelli. She was the daughter of the station manager and had no training in meteorology, and she was too young to have weather predictors like Dave&#x2019;s bunions and Guy&#x2019;s sciatica. Too bad she didn&#x2019;t have them, though. Maybe she&#x2019;d do a better job predicting the weather.</p><p>Heather&#x2019;s morning segment was currently closed-captioned on an ancient TV hanging from the rafters at the end of the counter. I shivered when I saw that she was wearing a sleeveless tank top and denim miniskirt. Heather noted, with a toss of her shiny black ponytail, that it was sleeting outside&#x2014;a combination of rain and heavy snow and whatever else Lake Ontario was throwing at little Sandy Harbor, New York. Heather named it a &#x201c;weather event&#x201d; and identified it as a &#x201c;lake-effect polar vortex,&#x201d; but I, Trixie Matkowski, just called it another &#x201c;massive weather mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s supposed to turn into a blizzard,&#x201d; said Huey Mobley, making a general announcement to everyone in the diner and who, having just walked in the door, had missed the bunion weather debate. Huey was delivering the Sunday edition of the <i>Sandy Harbor Lure</i>, our local newspaper, and stocking the paper box. &#x201c;And this new bout of sleet will make the roads slippery and icy. It says so right here in the <i>Lure</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>And the <i>Lure</i> was sacred in this area.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry. Your friendly Department of Public Works has the icy conditions under control, Huey.&#x201d; Snowplow driver Karen Metonti set her fork down on her plate, which had once held a stack of blueberry pancakes and crispy bacon, and raised her coffee mug in salute. &#x201c;My hopper is loaded with sand and salt, and I&#x2019;m ready to go at it again just as soon as I refill my coffee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on me, Karen,&#x201d; I said, bobbing to the surface of the counter. &#x201c;And help yourself to a couple of donuts for the road on your way out.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Trixie. It&#x2019;s going to be a long week if Flip a Coin is right,&#x201d; Karen said, zipping up her insulated orange jumpsuit. She slipped on sheepskin mittens and a matching hat, which were both so stuffed with fur they looked like they lodged a whole sheep. Then she clomped out in snowmobile boots, stopping to get a refill on her coffee from Nancy, my day waitress, and slip a couple of donuts into a white bakery bag.</p><p>Spotting several fruit hand pies my Amish friend Sarah Stolfus made revolving in slow circles in the pastry carousel, I walked toward it as if in a trance.</p><p>&#x201c;Beatrix Matkowski, don&#x2019;t you dare eat one of those hand pies, particularly not the cherry one. You just started another diet this morning,&#x201d; I mumbled to myself. I was hoping that maybe <i>myself</i> would listen, since I hated to be called Beatrix.</p><p>Before the hand pie could jump into my hand, I zoomed past the carousel and hustled back to my usual spot in the kitchen between the steam table and the huge black stove.</p><p>Phew. Crisis averted.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been here since midnight, and my shift would end at precisely eight o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;in about ten minutes. I enjoyed working the graveyard stint because I always found that the customers who came in to eat then were an interesting group. We had the extroverts who relished the camaraderie in the diner, loners who just wanted to be left alone, and customers who were full of energy and thrived on the night. Almost every shift, I had customers who simply ran out of steam, maybe after a long work shift, and happily snoozed in a booth.</p><p>But no matter who they were, they all wanted something to eat&#x2014;something warm and comforting&#x2014;and that was my specialty.</p><p>Right now I had four different kinds of soup on the stove in huger-than-huge pots: chicken noodle, broccoli and cheese, New England clam chowder, and bean soup. That was quite a variety, but there were a lot of people in Sandy Harbor who worked out in the elements and needed thawing out, and that meant soup&#x2014;lots and lots of comforting soup.</p><p>It also meant chili, mac and cheese, meat loaf.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I could go on and on, but before I got carried away by my thoughts, I needed to get some batter started for chocolate chip cookies, for the lunchtime rush.</p><p>I looked at the clock on the wall. Juanita Holgado, my morning cook, should be arriving momentarily. She loved to bake, so she could finish them for me. I was dead on my feet and yawning.</p><p>Maybe it was the weather. Thank goodness I didn&#x2019;t have any bunions or other body parts that could predict the weather. I usually took my chance on Flip a Coin&#x2019;s predictions.</p><p>But today all I needed to do was look outside the diner window&#x2014;the snow was falling fast in big, wet flakes. I could barely make out the outlines of Max and Clyde through the plummeting snow. They were my jacks-of-all-trades when they weren&#x2019;t taking long breaks to talk. Right now they were trying, in vain, to shovel and snow-blow the sidewalks around the Silver Bullet so that my patrons wouldn&#x2019;t slip, twirl, and triple flip and get a low mark from the Olympic judges.</p><p>But thank goodness for Karen, the first female snowplow driver in Sandy Harbor, who let the blade down on the village&#x2019;s snowplow and made a couple of swoops in my parking lot.</p><p>Karen wasn&#x2019;t supposed to use village equipment to do personal things or for local businesses, but sometimes we close the rule book here in small-town Sandy Harbor. The people here like to look out for their own and help out wherever and whenever they can.</p><p>In gratitude, I was going to make sure that Karen was well supplied with free coffee and donuts every time she stopped by the Silver Bullet this winter.</p><p>Deputy Sheriff Ty Brisco, a Texas transplant who lived above the bait shop next door, would accuse me of bribing a governmental official. But I&#x2019;d just call it being neighborly.</p><p>Ty was getting too stuffy lately anyway. He needed to loosen up. But then again, maybe he had weather-predicting body parts that were giving him a hard time. Or perhaps he was just grumpy about the snowy weather since he was from Houston.</p><p>Just then I saw Ty&#x2019;s big monster of an SUV do a half spin into the parking lot. He easily got the big black machine under control before he ended up in the ten-foot-high snowbank, and he safely parked in a spot cleared by Karen.</p><p>I peeked from the corner of the pass-through window, waiting for Ty to walk into the diner. It wasn&#x2019;t because I loved to watch the way he walked or liked to listen to his sexy cowboy drawl or because I enjoyed bantering with him.</p><p>No way.</p><p>I just liked to talk to him.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t interested in any kind of a personal relationship with Ty. I was still busy building and cementing a brick wall around myself and my heart&#x2014;mainly due to my divorce from my ex-husband, Deputy Doug Burnham, slimy cheater. A couple of years ago he&#x2019;d found a fertile twentysomething-year-old who gave him twins, Brittany and Tiffany, and I became yesterday&#x2019;s birdcage liner.</p><p>After all was said and done, I&#x2019;d left Philly and headed for my favorite place on earth: Sandy Harbor, New York. And then the planets aligned when my aunt Stella decided that the diner, cottages, and Victorian farmhouse she owned weren&#x2019;t going to be the same without her beloved husband, Porky, and she offered to sell everything to me with for a &#x201c;family discount and easy-payment plan.&#x201d;</p><p>We worked out the details on a Silver Bullet place mat. After the dust settled, she handed me a wad of keys and I handed her the contents of my purse, my bank accounts, and all the change I had in the ashtray of my car. Aunt Stella then took off for Florida and an Alaskan cruise with her gal pals, leaving me with balloon payments scheduled through our lifetimes and a diner that was OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY, AIR-CONDITIONED, BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY.</p><p>Trying to be casual, I took another peek through the pass-through window to see if Ty had appeared yet.</p><p>The pass-through window didn&#x2019;t have any glass in it and wasn&#x2019;t used for passing anything through it, but it was my way to see what was going on in the front of the diner whenever I was in the back.</p><p>And right now I was hoping to enjoy some cowboy eye candy.</p><p>The door opened and there was a collective groan when snow blew into the diner and landed on some of the customers seated near the door.</p><p>Sheesh.</p><p>Ty should have waited until the outside door had closed before he opened the inside door, but the wind took it. He mumbled a sheepish &#x201c;sorry&#x201d; to the folks sitting nearby, took his cowboy hat off, and brushed off the plastic bonnet that protected his hat.</p><p>How cute!</p><p>The plastic bonnet reminded me of my aunt Helen&#x2019;s living room, with her plastic-covered sofa and chairs.

With a dazzling variety of forms seamlesslyintertwined with their context, his sculptures evoke fantastical images of nests, cocoons, cones, castles, and beehives. Over the last twenty-five years, Dougherty has built more than two hundred works throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia that range from stand-alone structures to a kind of modern primitive architectureevery piece mesmerizing in its ability to fly through trees, overtake buildings, and virtually defy gravity. <em>Stickwork</em>, Dougherty's first monograph, features thirty-eight of his organic, dynamic works that twist the line between architecture, landscape, and art. Constructed on-site using locally sourced materials and local volunteer labor, Dougherty's sculptures are tangles of twigs and branches that have been transformed into something unexpected and wild, elegant and artful, and often humorous. Sometimes freestanding, and other times wrapping around trees, buildings, railings, and rooms, they are constructed indoors and in nature. As organic matter, the stick sculptures eventually disintegrate and fade back into the landscape. Featuring a wealth of photographs and drawings documenting the construction process of each remarkable structure, <em>Stickwork</em> preserves the legend of the man who weaves the simplest of materials into a singular artistic triumph.</p><p>Patrick Dougherty grew up in the woods of North Carolina and now lives in Chapel Hill."Patrick Dougherty... weaves tree saplings into whirling, animated shapes that resemble tumbleweeds or gusts of wind." --The New York Times<br><br>"A very inspiring book, Stickwork could well have you out in the woods, coaxing your own twigs into a new creation." --mocoloco.com<br><br>"The photos are quite impressive and I can only imagine how incredible it is to see one of these pieces in person.

The two great developments of this era in Russian history-the enserfment of the peasantry and the conquest of a vast Eastern empire-fundamentally concerned spatial control and concepts of movements across the land. In Cartographies of Tsardom, Valerie Kivelson explores how these twin themes of fixity and mobility obliged Russians, from tsar to peasant, to think in spatial terms. She builds her case through close study of two very different kinds of maps: the hundreds of local maps hand-drawn by amateurs as evidence in property litigations, and the maps of the new territories that stretched from the Urals to the Pacific. In both the simple (but strikingly beautiful and even moving) maps that local residents drafted and in the more formal maps of the newly conquered Siberian spaces, Kivelson shows that the Russians saw the land (be it a peasant's plot or the Siberian taiga) as marked by the grace of divine providence. She argues that the unceasing tension between fixity and mobility led to the emergence in Eurasia of an empire quite different from that in North America. In her words, the Russian empire that took shape in the decades before Peter the Great proclaimed its existence was a "spacious mantle," a "patchwork quilt of difference under a single tsar" that granted religious and cultural space to non-Russian, non-Orthodox populations even as it strove to tie them down to serve its own growing fiscal needs. The unresolved, perhaps unresolvable, tension between these contrary impulses was both the strength and the weakness of empire in Russia. This handsomely illustrated and beautifully written book, which features twenty-four pages of color plates, will appeal to everyone fascinated by the history of Russia and all who are intrigued by the art of mapmaking.</p></p><p>"Valerie Kivelson's analysis of mapping and legal disputes in the pre-Petrine Muscovite empire makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the organization of property and territory and so of the nature of serfdom and the Muscovite empire itself. This is exactly the kind of book that demonstrates that maps cannot be relegated to mere illustration; rather, in their production and use, they have been crucial components of all sorts of spatial practice in the early modern and modern worlds. Solidly rooted in empirical research, Cartographies of Tsardom blends the social with the cultural in a truly innovative manner."-Matthew Edney, Director, History of Cartography Project, University of Wisconsin-Madison <p>"This is a wondrous book that, figuratively and literally, adds another dimension to Russian history. Like a Rosetta Stone, the book introduces the reader to a little-known language, cartography in early modern Russia. With its novel approach, broad comparative context, and graceful prose, Valerie Kivelson's book is a landmark achievement."&#x2014;Michael Khodarkovsky, author of Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1600&#x2013;1800 </p><p>"Cartographies of Tsardom is a fascinating interdisciplinary book that breaks new ground in assessing the roles of history, geography, social structure, and religion in Early Modern Russia. Valerie Kivelson provides a compelling argument for using visual material as evidence of a consultative rather than dictatorial autocracy in Early Modern Russia. New territorial maps and seemingly mundane maps of land disputes turn out to reflect a center-periphery dynamic of nuanced interaction rather than one-sided dominance, a relationship reiterated in contemporary court cases and government policy. In the charting of physical space, provincial Russians appear determined to mark the value of their own sociopolitical status, all the while conceiving their place in the world within an articulated model of paradise."&#x2014;Michael Flier, Harvard University </p><p>"In this imaginative and provocative book, Valerie Kivelson explores early Russian maps as a source for understanding the mind of early Russia and offers intriguing hypotheses about conceptions of empire, space, law, and society in Muscovy."&#x2014;Richard Wortman, Columbia University </p><p>"Cartographies of Tsardom confirms Valerie Kivelson as one of the most imaginative (and persuasive) interpreters of Early Modern Russia at work today. Relying chiefly on little-studied seventeenth-century maps, she illuminates many of the most important questions about Muscovite Russia: the relationship of state to society, the growth of a multi-national empire, the rise of serfdom, and the place of Orthdox Christianity in the lives of laymen. Along the way, she demonstrates that space and its representations are crucial to the understanding of Russian history and culture."&#x2014;Daniel Rowland, University of Kentucky</p><p> Valerie Kivelson is Arthur F.

If you&#39;re feeding livestock in confinement rather than on pasture, you&#39;re working too hard and spending too much money. Your permanent pasture is a valuable resource that up till now has been wasted. Forget about how pastures are. Think of how they could be if they were managed with the same amount of attention that you give to your other crops. Voisin management intensive grazing takes into account the needs of both animals and plants, rather than animals alone. Its use can at least double or triple your pasture&#39;s productivity. This book explains why and how to use management intensive grazing, and what to expect from its use. It shows a way to simplify your farm operation, reduce its labor needs, increase its productivity, and improve your quality of life.</p><p>For nearly 20 years, Bill Murphy has been a leader in North America helping farmers to use the pasture resource to its fullest potential in cutting production costs. As many successful pasture-based farmers know, there is no cheaper way to feed livestock than on pasture and this book explains how to do it!I grew up on a farm, close to animals and the land. In all my studies at university I didn&#39;t learn anything more important or valuable than the farmer&#39;s perceptions, sensibilities, and common sense gained while living and working with my parents on the family farm. I wrote this book as if I was talking to one person, another farmer or someone who dreams of farming, so it reads easily and is easy to understand the concepts needed to manage pasture well.

With its larger-than-normal image sensor, superior image quality, and impressive array of features for creative photography, this camera has attracted a large and dedicated following in the photography community. However, the camera does not come with a printed manual, or even a PDF manual that can readily be printed for reference. So, until now, it has been difficult for users of the camera to find answers to their questions about the use of the camera&#39;s many controls, menus, and features. With the release of this new book, White Knight Press has provided users of the RX100 with a comprehensive guide to all operations, features, menus, and controls of this amazing camera. Using a patient, tutorial-like approach, the book provides guidance to beginning and intermediate photographers not only about how to accomplish things with the RX100, but when and why to use the camera&#39;s many features. The book does not assume any specialized knowledge by the reader as it explains topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, shutter priority, exposure compensation, white balance, and ISO sensitivity. The book also provides full details of the camera&#39;s numerous menu options for playback, setup, and customizing the operation of the various buttons and other controls. The book&#39;s more than 300 photographs, most of them in full color, illustrate the RX100&#39;s controls, shooting screens, and menus. The photographs also provide examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Photo Creativity settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing of images; the Scene shooting mode, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and action shots; the Creative Style and Picture Effect menu options, which offer dramatic options for altering the appearance of images; and the camera&#39;s strong array of features for continuous shooting and shooting in dim lighting. In addition, the book goes beyond the bounds of everyday photography, and provides introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, astrophotography, and macro photography. The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the RX100, which can shoot high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound, and which offers manual control of exposure and focus during movie recording. In three appendices, the book provides information about accessories available for the RX100, including cases, external flash units, and filter adapters, and includes a list of web sites and other resources for further information. Also, the book includes a detailed appendix with helpful Quick Tips that give particular insights into how to take advantage of the camera&#39;s features in the most efficient ways possible. The guidebook to the RX100 includes a detailed Table of Contents and Index, so the reader can quickly find needed information about any particular feature or aspect of the camera.</p><p>Alexander S.

Soon abandoned by his comfort-loving companion, the restless World War I veteran spent an enlightening year learning&#x2014;often the hard way&#x2014;how to paddle and sail on windy lakes, hunt and fish for food, bake "rough delicacies" in a reflector oven, and build winter-proof shelters. His how-to descriptions of trapping beaver, mink, and other game are unsurpassed in their detail.<br><br>Cook also found his way into the border community of Ojibwe and mixed-blood families and a motley assortment of mysterious travelers, game wardens, and loners, including trapper Bill Berglund (who "adopted" Cook until the tenderfoot's eagerness to harvest pelts came between them).<br><br>Cook's adventure climaxed in a 700-mile expedition by dogsled north into Canada, where he reached the limits of his endurance&#x2014;and just barely lived to tell the tale.<br><br>For anyone who loves the Boundary Waters or wonders what this rugged region was like not so long ago, Cook's story reveals a world still ruled by nature but on the brink of change.</p><p>Charles Ira Cook JrCook had been in the Army Air Service in World War I and was a restless young man after the war. In the foreword to this book, the author's son, Harry B. Cook, describes how his 27-year-old father and a friend set out in 1919 for a year's journey into the woods of the Minnesota-Ontario border country. They fished, hunted, and trapped and traveled by canoe and dog sled. In the 1950s, after a varied career as a logger, owner of a grocery-store chain and a dairy bar, and worker in the Office of Price Administration in World War II, Cook took a course in writing and typed up an account of his adventure in the wilderness but failed to find a publisher. Decades later, his son has finally taken the edited manuscript to publication. An interesting yarn that tells of Cook's adventures and the people he met, this will be of interest to local history collections in public and academic libraries.DGeorge M.

More remarkably yet, &#x201c;Chief&#x201d; Bender&#x2019;s Hall of Fame career unfolded in the face of enormous prejudice. Winner of the 2009 Seymour Medal, this skillfully told and complete account of Bender&#x2019;s life is also a portrait of greatness of character in the face of incredible pressure.&nbsp;With a journalist&#x2019;s eye for detail and a novelist&#x2019;s feel for storytelling, Tom Swift takes readers on Bender&#x2019;s improbable journey&#x2014;from his early years on the White Earth Reservation, to his development at the Carlisle Indian School, to his big break and eventual rise to the pinnacle of baseball. The story of a paradoxical American sports hero, one who achieved a once-unfathomable celebrity while suffering the harsh injustices of a racially intolerant world, <i>Chief Bender&#x2019;s Burden</i> is an eye-opening and inspiring narrative of a unique American life.</p><p>Tom Swift is an award-winning author and journalist, and a member of the Society for American Baseball Research.

As in the previous edition (Beavers), the narrator introduces each superpower, or trait, by describing it as a special ability and then explaining how it works. Text boxes and quizzes are interspersed throughout and add a bit of fun. The illustrations, which have a vintage look to them, alternate between comic depictions and detailed diagrams that identify different physical features of moles and their habitats. The text remains friendly, though some terms, such as "indefatigable paws of power" may reach over the heads of most readers.

This division is perfectly suitable to the nature of the thing; and the only improvement that can be made in it is to add the principle on which it is based, so that we may both satisfy ourselves of its completeness, and also be able to determine correctly the necessary subdivisions. All rational knowledge is either material or formal: the former considers some object, the latter is concerned only with the form of the understanding and of the reason itself, and with the universal laws of thought in general without distinction of its objects. Formal philosophy is called logic. Material philosophy, however, has to do with determinate objects and the laws to which they are subject, is again twofold; for these laws are either laws of nature or of freedom. The science of the former is physics, that of the latter, ethics; they are also called natural philosophy and moral philosophy respectively.</p><p>Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) was born in Konigsberg, Prussia, where he remained his entire life.

Throughout, there is the body, a reclamation and pushback against cultures that simultaneously sexualize and shame women. And there is a softness as inherent as rage, a resisting of stereotypes that too often speak louder than the complexities of a colonized, yet resilient, cultural identity.<br><br> Rizkallah&#x2019;s <i>the magic my body becomes</i> is an exciting new book from an exciting young poet, a love letter to a people as well as a fist in the air.

For Ren�e de Maucombe, this means an arranged marriage with a country gentleman of Provence, a fine if slightly dull man for whom she feels admiration but nothing more. Meanwhile, Louise de Chaulieu makes for her family&#x2019;s house in Paris, intent on enjoying her freedom to the fullest: glittering balls, the opera, and above all, she devoutly hopes, the torments and ecstasies of true love and passion. What will come of these very different lives?<br><br> Despite Honor� de Balzac&#x2019;s title, these aren&#x2019;t memoirs; rather, this is an epistolary novel. For some ten years, these two will&#x2014;enthusiastically if not always faithfully&#x2014;keep up their correspondence, obeying their vow to tell each other every tiny detail of their strange new lives, comparing their destinies, defending and sometimes bemoaning their choices, detailing the many changes, personal and social, that they undergo. As Balzac writes, &#x201c;Ren�e is reason...Louise is wildness...and both will lose.&#x201d; Balzac being Balzac, he seems to argue for the virtues of one of these lives over the other; but Balzac being Balzac, that argument remains profoundly ambiguous. &#x201c;I would,&#x201d; he once wrote, &#x201c;rather be killed by Louise than live a long life with Ren�e.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Honor� de Balzac&nbsp;</b>(1799&#x2013;1850), one of the greatest and most influential of novelists, was born in Tours and educated at the Coll�ge de Vend�me and the Sorbonne.

Balzac then conceived his great work, <i>La Com�die humaine</i>, an ongoing series of novels in which he set out to offer a complete picture of contemporary society and manners. Always working under an extraordinary burden of debt, Balzac wrote some eighty-five novels in the course of his last twenty years, including such masterpieces as <i>P�re Goriot</i>, <i>Eug�nie Grandet,</i><br> <i>Lost Illusions</i>, and <i>Cousin Bette</i>.

While many biblical texts do condemn other deities, many other passages show how early Israelites sometimes accepted the reality of deities worshiped by other peoples. Looking closely both at relevant biblical texts and at their cultural contexts, Mark S. Smith demonstrates that the biblical attitude toward other deities is not uniformly negative, as is commonly supposed. He traces the historical development of Israel&#x2019;s &#x201c;one-god worldview,&#x201d; linking it to the rise of the surrounding Mesopotamian empires.<br><br>Smith&#x2019;s study also produces evidence undermining a common modern assumption among historians of religion that polytheism is tolerant while monotheism is prone to intolerance and violence. Drawing both on ancient sources and on modern, theoretical approaches, Smith&#x2019;s God in Translation masterfully reveals the complexity of attitudes in ancient Israel toward foreign deities and makes a case for an ecumenism based on respect for local traditions and not based on a western notion of universal religion.</p><p>Mark S.

In the late 1960s he was a young pacifist who helped to found one of the most radical political organizations in U.S. history, the Weather Underground. In a new era of antiwar activism and suppression of protest, his story, <i>Fugitive Days</i>, is more poignant and relevant than ever.</p><p><b>Bill Ayers</b> is the author of the acclaimed and controversial memoir <i>Fugitive Days</i>, its follow up <i>Public Enemy</i>, and many books on education, including <i>To Teach</i>, <i>Teaching Toward Freedom</i>, and <i>A Kind and Just Parent</i>. He is the founder of the Small Schools Workshop and was, until his retirement, Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He lives in Hyde Park, Chicago.[Ayers's] memoir is a breath of fresh air in this self-absorbed age. Ayers discusses his reservations about the use of violence to achieve an end to violence (reservations he held then as well), but he is unrepentant in believing that . . . right-minded people have an obligation to resist unjust wars. . . . There are many lessons still to be learned from such narratives. Recommended.&#x2014;David Keymer, <i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"[A] gripping and provocative story . . .

That it is written in a consistently absorbing style with many passages of undiluted brilliance only adds to its appeal.&#x2014;Thomas Frank, author of <i>One Market Under God</i> and <i>What's the Matter with Kansas?</i><br><br>"A gripping account . . . Ayers describes well the deep emotions that inflamed the '60s."&#x2014;John Patrick Diggins, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"This is a precious book, not simply because it offers a gripping personal account of the primal American suspense story of life on the run, but, more important, because it recreates a critical point of view and way of thinking that we seem, even a few decades later, barely able to recall."&#x2014;Scott Turow, author of <i>Ordinary Heroes</i> and <i>Ultimate Punishment</i><br><br>"It's been a long time since American political culture last leftward . . .

This memoir rings of hard-learned truth and integrity and is an important contribution to literature on 1960s culture and American radicalism."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"What makes <i>Fugitive Days</i> unique is its unsparing detail and its marvelous human coherence and integrity. Bill Ayers's America and his family background, his education, his political awakening, his anger and involvement, his anguished re-emergence from the shadows: all these are rendered in their truth without a trace of nostalgia or 'second thinking.' For anyone who cares about the sorry mess we are in, this book is essential, indeed necessary, reading."&#x2014;Edward W. Said, author of <i>Reflections on Exile</i> and <i>Out of Place</i><br><br>"This remarkable memoir gives us the visceral experience of being on the run. Ayers writes with eloquence and irony. This is one man's amazingly honest, authentic, and gripping testament&#x2014;and a helluva story it makes."&#x2014;Phillip Lopate, author of <i>Portrait of My Body</i><br><br>"A wild and painful ride in the savage years of the late sixties. A very good book about a terrifying time in America."&#x2014;Hunter S. Thompson, author of <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> and <i>Hell's Angels</i><br><br>"For anyone who wants to think hard about the social conflagration the Vietnam War produced in the U.S., and more generally about a citizen's obligations in troubled times, Ayers's powerful, morally charged account of a life and a society in the political balance is provocative reading."&#x2014;David Farber, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>Shadow Divers Exposed: The Real Saga of the U-869</h2><p>The U-869 was one of more than 1,200 U-boats that were constructed for the Nazi war machine. It was sunk off the American eastern seaboard by a combination hedgehog and depth-charge attack. There were no survivors to tell the tragic tale. Now, for the first time, the real saga of the U-869 can be told in full. Archival documents have established that the U-boat was sunk by two American destroyer escorts. Seven crewmembers of those aggressive warships have supplemented the official record with their personal recollections. Shadow Divers Exposed works on a multitude of levels. It presents the actual circumstances that surrounded the loss of the U-869. It puts the discovery of the U-869 into perspective with other U-boats that have been found in American waters. It provides an overview of the U-boat war through accounts of other U-boat losses. And it corrects some of the gross errors, wild exaggerations, and deliberate distortions that filled the pages of Shadow Divers. The author interviewed a number of witnesses whose testimony contradicted the theatrical plot and boastful embellishments that formed the essential ingredients of Shadow Divers. Some of these witnesses actually performed the deeds for which the chosen protagonists of Shadow Divers were given credit. These witnesses disputed many of the fictitious elements that ran rampant through the pages of Shadow Divers. By means of forensic analyses of shipwreck collapse, torpedo mechanics, and U-boat survivors&#39; accounts, the present volume explains why the U-869 could not have been sunk by a circular run of its own torpedo - as Shadow Divers had its uninformed readers believe.</p><p></p><h2>Ultimate Courage</h2><p><b>LOVE IS AN ACT OF BRAVERY</b><br><br>Retired Navy SEAL Alex Rojas is putting his life back together, one piece at a time.

Combining a historical understanding of the Hasidic movement with a journalist&#39;s discerning eye, Harris captures in rich detail the day-to-day life of this traditional and often misunderstood community. Harris chronicles the personal transformation she experienced as she grew closer to the largely hidden men and women of the Hasidic world.&#34;--Page 4 of cover.</p><p>Hasidism, the Jewish revivalist movement begun in 18th century Poland, encourages prayer, mysticism, singing and sanctification of daily life. The Lubavitchers, the largest of some 40 Hasidic sects, today live mostly in Brooklyn's Crown Heights. There Harris befriended a Lubavitcher couple and penetrated a sect known for its strict adherence to Old World customs, its deep suspicion of outsiders and secretiveness. To some, the Lubavitchers seem frozen in the past; to Harris, a sympathetic observer, they "live in a kind of perpetual Biblical present" by linking everyday events in their personal lives to a spiritual heritage that is very much alive. Appropriately, Harris shifts back and forth in time, from the Crown Heights household where she was for years a regular visitor, to the exploits of Israel ben Eliezer, founder of Hasidism, and other Eastern European wise men who were inspired by kabbalistic teachings. This work of cultural anthropology helps readers to understand the Lubavitchers while gaining respect for their carefully guarded traditions. First serial to the New Yorker; Jewish Book Club main selection. November<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.The author is a staff writer for the New Yorker who approached a family of the Lubavitcher sect with the purpose of writing about their holidays, everyday observances, and place in the commu nity. The result of her year-long effort is a warm, informative, highly readable book (the material was serialized Sep tember 1985 in the New Yorker) . Harris joins the Konigsberg family in Crown Heights at Purim and returns for every major and minor holiday, and of course for many a weekly Shabbat. But we get much more than just Holy Days from her: there are also lucid descriptions and explanations of rituals for all family events (with death getting only a pass ing mention) and we learn a great deal about the history of the Lubavitch movement and its leaders, its relation ship to other Hasidic sects and its stance toward Israel.

For the founder of the abbey was none other than St Ailbe, the man who brought Christianity to Muman, converted its king and baptised him at Cashel in AD448. But now, calamity has struck the community of the abbey. Not only has an elderly monk suddenly disappeared, but the holy relics of St Ailbe have also vanished. These sacred relics are not just the concern of the abbey&#39;s community but are a priceless icon and political symbol of the entire kingdom. So who would have dared to take them? Sister Fidelma, together with Saxon Brother Eadulf, are asked to investigate. It seems there is more to the disappearances than meets the eye; much more. Fidelma gradually uncovers a sinister conspiracy, in which the participants will stop at nothing - even murder - to achieve their aims ...</p><p>Peter Tremayne is the fiction pseudonym of a well-known authority on the ancient Celts, who has utilised his knowledge of the Brehon law system and 7th-Century Irish society to create a new concept in detective fiction.&#39;The background detail is brilliantly defined&#39; The Times &#39;A clever plot, ingeniously resolved...the atmosphere of 7th century Ireland is so well recaptured that it becomes absolutely real.&#39; SHOTS A clever plot, ingeniously resolved...the atmosphere of 7th century Ireland is so well recaptured that it becomes absolutely real. * SHOTS *</p><h2>The Wicked Ways of Alexander Kidd</h2><p><strong>"Deliciously romantic and sensual . . .

They are fascinating for two reasons. First, they gave rise to a new generation of Rousseau scholars, attentive not just to Rousseau's ideas, but also to those of his concepts that were buried beneath metaphors or fictional situations and characters. A new way of coming to terms with Rousseau's theoretical rigour, beneath his apparent reveries and sentimental flights of fancy, was here put to work. Second, we are now discovering that the 'late Althusser's' theses about aleatory materialism and the need to break with the strict determinism of theories of history in order to devise a new philosophy 'for Marx' were being worked out well before 1985 - in this reading of Rousseau dating from twelve years earlier, which introduces into Rousseau's text the ideas of the void, the accident, the take, and the necessity of contingency.</p><p><b>Louis Althusser</b> was born in Algeria in 1918 and died in France in 1990. He taught philosophy for many years at the Ecole Normale Sup�rieure in Paris, and was a leading intellectual in the French Communist Party. His books include <i>For Marx; Reading Capital</i> (with Etienne Balibar); <i>Essays in Ideology; Politics and History: Montesquieu, Rousseau, Marx; Machiavelli and Us; </i>and <i>The Spectre of Hegel.</i></p><h2>The Sweethearts&#39; Knitting Club</h2><p>The first book in Lori Wilde&#x2019;s new series set in small-town Twilight, Texas, <em>The Sweethearts&#x2019; Knitting Club</em> is the story of Flynn McGregor, a young woman who&#x2019;s always done exactly what her friends, family, and fellow knitters have told her to do&#x2014;until Jesse Calloway, her bad-boy high school sweetheart, roars back into town.</p><p><blockquote><p>"Throw a penny in the fountain of the Twilight town square, and you'll be married to your first love . . .

The Bone Collection presents her trademark artistry in this collection of thrilling short fiction. In First Bones, a prequel to Reichs&#39;s first novel she at last reveals the tale of how Tempe became a forensic anthropologist. In this never-before-published story, Tempe recalls the case that lured her from a promising career in academia into the grim but addictive world of criminal investigation. (It all began with a visit from a pair of detectives--and a John Doe recovered from an arson scene in a trailer.) The collection is rounded out with three more stories that take Tempe from the low country of the Florida Everglades, where she makes a grisly discovery in the stomach of an eighteen-foot Burmese python, to the heights of Mount Everest, where a frozen corpse is unearthed. No matter where she goes, Tempe&#39;s cases make for the most gripping reading.</p><p>Kathy Reichs is the author of eighteen &#34;New York Times&#34; bestselling novels featuring forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan.

In the room, only the soft rhythmic pinging of sensors monitoring vital signs.<br><br>His face looked gaunt and greenish gray in the glow of machines tracking his pulse and respirations. Every now and then I glanced at a screen. Watching the lines jump their erratic zigzag patterns. Willing the pinging and jumping to continue.<br><br>Surgical Trauma Intensive Care Unit. So cold. So sterile. Yet a human touch: a stain shaped like Mickey&#x2019;s ears on one rail of the overcomplicated bed. Funny what you notice when under stress.<br><br>A sheet covered him from the neck down, leaving only his arms exposed. A pronged tube delivered oxygen to his nostrils. A needle infused liquids into a vein in his right wrist. The arm with the IV lay tucked to his torso. The other rested on his chest, elbow flexed at an obtuse angle.<br><br>I watched his sheet-�clad chest rise and fall. Somehow his body looked smaller than normal. Shrunken. Or was it an illusion created by the fish-�tank illumination?<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t move, didn&#x2019;t blink. In the eerie light, his lids appeared translucent purple, like the thinly peeled skin of a Bermuda onion. His eyeballs had receded deep into their orbits.<br><br>Hollywood&#x2019;s dramatic death scenes are a scam. A slug to the body destroys roughly two ounces of tissue, no more. A bullet doesn&#x2019;t necessarily drop a man on the spot. To kill instantly, you have to shoot into the brain or high up in the spinal cord, or cause hemorrhage by hitting a main vessel or the heart. None of those things had happened to him. He&#x2019;d survived until a late-�night dog walker stumbled upon him, unconscious and bleeding but still showing a pulse.<br><br>The wee-�hours call had roused me from a deep sleep. Adrenaline rush.

The internal damage was too severe. He was dying.<br><br>How could that be? Men his age didn&#x2019;t die. But they did. We all did. America was armed to the teeth and no one was safe.<br><br>I felt a tremor in my chest. Fought it down.<br><br>Uncaring death was about to punch a hole in my life. I didn&#x2019;t want to consider the coming weeks. Months. We had done so much together. Fed off each other physically, emotionally. Despite the occasional aloofness, abruptness. The arguments. The unexplained retreats. The exchanges weren&#x2019;t always pleasant, but they spurred the process, helped us accomplish more than either of us would have managed solo. Now the future looked bleak. Unbearable sadness wrapped me like a shroud.<br><br>He&#x2019;d been a good man. Capable. Devoted to his work. Always busy, but willing to listen, to provide feedback, sometimes outrageous, sometimes sage. Forever in motion.<br><br>I thought of the hours we&#x2019;d spent together. The shared challenges. The identification of issues and approaches toward solutions. The painstaking attention to detail that could knit together a comprehensible whole from fragments. The shared sense of accomplishment in uncovering answers to perplexing questions. The mutual frustration and disappointment when no solution emerged.<br><br>I&#x2019;d seen so much death. Corpses whole and partial, known and unknown. Lives ended in every conceivable manner. From the very old to the very young, male and female. At times cause was apparent, at others a puzzle requiring prolonged assessment and all my acuity. He was my greatest resource.<br><br>Throughout my career I was often the bearer of heartbreaking news. The changer of lives, informing anxious next of kin that their loved ones were dead. He&#x2019;d been there. Or listened to my telling. Death was a constant in my work, and now death would put an end to this cherished partnership.<br><br>I looked again at the man in the bed. All was past. There would be no future.<br><br>The door opened and a nurse entered, rubber soles noiseless on the immaculate tile. She was short and round with ebony skin that gleamed in the monitors&#x2019; reflected light. A badge on her scrubs said v. sule.<br><br>Nurse V.

Paranoia most mornings shocks us to wakefulness, and we totter out under the ghostly sun. At night fear agitates the darkness. Dreams of empty streets flitter through our fitful heads. Enduring these omens, as vague and elusive as the obscure horror they suggest, we strain to think of exactly what scares us. Our minds run over a daunting litany of global problems. We hope with our listing to find a meaning, a clue to our unease. <br>We mentally scan the scene. We are on the verge of eroding away our ozone layer. Even as I write, this erosion is causing melting of the polar ice cap. Within decades we could face major oceanic flooding. Even our greatest skyscrapers, yearning heavenward, could soon be devoured by indifferent waves. We are also close to annihilating hundreds of exquisite animals. These beasts&#x2014;white rhinos and Sumatran tigers and California condors&#x2014;have been in the making for millions of years. Within almost a human lifetime our disregard for nature has put these sublime creatures almost into extinction. Soon our forests will be empty of colorful torsos and exotic wings. These formerly teeming groves will be as bland as pavement. Moreover, we now find ourselves on the verge of a new cold war. Nuclear warheads before long will be on the rise again. The fears of the middle of the last century will return. We&#x2019;ll wonder: Will this year be the last that humans breathe and walk on this time-rending earth?<br>I can now add another threat, perhaps as dangerous as the most apocalyptic of concerns. We are possibly not far away from eradicating a major cultural force, a serious inspiration to invention, the muse behind much art and poetry and music. We are wantonly hankering to rid the world of numerous ideas and visions, multitudinous innovations and meditations. We are right at this moment annihilating melancholia.<br>We wonder if the wide array of antidepressants will one day make sweet sorrow a thing of the past. We wonder if soon enough every single American will be happy. We wonder if we will become a society of self-satisfied smiles. Treacly expressions will be painted on our faces as we parade through the pastel aisles. Bedazzling neon will spotlight our way.<br>What is behind this desire to purge sadness from our lives, especially in America, the land of splendid dreams and wild success? Why are most Americans so utterly willing to have an essential part of their hearts sliced away and discarded like so much waste? What are we to make of this American obsession with happiness, an obsession that could well lead to a sudden extinction of the creative impulse, that could result in an extermination as horrible as those foreshadowed by global warming and environmental crisis and nuclear proliferation? What drives this rage for complacency, for the innocuous smile? What fosters this desperate contentment?<br>These questions of course cut against the grain of what most Americans claim to think. A recent poll conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that almost 85 percent of Americans believe that they are very happy or at least happy. The psychological world is now abuzz with a new field, positive psychology, devoted to finding ways to enhance happiness through pleasure, engagement, and meaning. Psychologists practicing this brand of therapy are leaders in a novel sort of science, the science of happiness. Mainstream publishers are now learning from the self-help industry and printing thousands of books on how to be happy and on why we are happy. The self-help press fills the shelves with step-by-step plans for worldly satisfaction. Everywhere I see advertisements offering even more happiness, happiness on land or by sea, in a car or under the stars. And as I have already noted, doctors now offer a wide array of drugs that might eradicate depression forever. It seems truly, perhaps more than ever before, an age of almost perfect contentment, a brave new world of persistent good fortune, joy without trouble, felicity with no penalty.<br>Surely all this happiness can&#x2019;t be for real. How can so many people be happy in the midst of all the problems that beset our globe&#x2014;not only the collective and apocalyptic ills just mentioned but also those particular irritations that bedevil our everyday existences, those money issues and marital spats, those stifling vocations and lonely dawns? Are we to believe that four out of every five Americans can be content amid the general woe? Are some people lying, or are they simply afraid to be honest in a culture in which the status quo is nothing short of manic bliss? Aren&#x2019;t we suspicious of this statistic? Aren&#x2019;t we further troubled by our culture&#x2019;s overemphasis on happiness? Don&#x2019;t we fear that this rabid focus on exuberance leads to half-lives, to bland existences, to wastelands of mechanistic behavior? <br>I for one am afraid that our American culture&#x2019;s overemphasis on happiness at the expense of sadness might be dangerous, a wanton forgetting of an essential part of a full life. I further am wary in the face of this possibility: to desire only happiness in a world undoubtedly tragic is to become inauthentic, to settle for unrealistic abstractions that ignore concrete situations. I am finally fearful over our society&#x2019;s efforts to expunge melancholia from the system. Without the agitations of the soul, would all of our magnificently yearning towers topple? Would our heart-torn symphonies cease? <br>I want to get to the bottom of these fears, to see if they&#x2019;re legitimate or just neurotic grumblings. My feeling right now is that they are valid. This sense grows out of my suspicion that the predominant form of American happiness breeds blandness. This kind of happiness appears to entertain a craven disregard for the value of sadness. This brand of supposed joy, moreover, seems to foster an ongoing ignorance of life&#x2019;s enduring and vital polarity between agony and ecstasy, dejection and ebulliance. Trying to forget sadness and its integral place in the great rhythm of the cosmos, this sort of happiness insinuates in the end that the blues are an aberrant state that should be cursed as weakness of will or removed with the help of a little pink pill. <br>Let me be clear. I&#x2019;m right now thinking only of this specific American type of happiness. I&#x2019;m not questioning joy in general. For instance, I&#x2019;m not challenging that unbearable exuberance that suddenly emerges from long suffering. I&#x2019;m not troubled by that hard-earned tranquillity that comes from long meditation on the world&#x2019;s sorrows. I&#x2019;m not criticizing that slow-burning bliss that issues from a life spent helping those that hurt. <br>Likewise, I&#x2019;d like to be clear about this: I don&#x2019;t want to romanticize clinical depression. I realize that there are many lost souls out there who require medication to keep from killing themselves or harming their friends and families. I don&#x2019;t want to question the pharmaceutical therapies of the seriously depressed. Not only am I not qualified to do this (I&#x2019;m not a psychotherapist marshaling evidence, but a literary humanist searching for a deeper life), I&#x2019;m also not willing to argue against medications that simply make existence bearable for so many with biochemical disorders. <br>I do, however, wonder why so many people experiencing melancholia are now taking pills meant simply to ease the pain, to turn scowls once more into smiles. Of course there is a fine line between what I&#x2019;m calling melancholia and what society calls depression. In my mind, what separates the two is degree of activity. Both forms are more or less chronic sadness that leads to ongoing unease with how things are&#x2014;persistent feelings that the world as it is is not quite right, that it is a place of suffering, stupidity, and evil. Depression (as I see it, at least) causes apathy in the face of this unease, lethargy approaching total paralysis, an inability to feel much of anything one way or another. In contrast, melancholia (in my eyes) generates a deep feeling in regard to this same anxiety, a turbulence of heart that results in an active questioning of the status quo, a perpetual longing to create new ways of being and seeing.<br>Our culture seems to confuse these two and thus treat melancholia as an aberrant state, a vile threat to our pervasive notions of happiness&#x2014;happiness as immediate gratification, happiness as superficial comfort, happiness as static contentment. Of course the question immediately arises: Who wouldn&#x2019;t question this apparently hollow form of American happiness? Aren&#x2019;t all of us late at night, when we&#x2019;re honest with ourselves, opposed to shallow happiness? Most likely we are, but isn&#x2019;t it possible that many of us fall into superficiality without knowing it? Aren&#x2019;t some of us so smitten with the American dream that we have become brainwashed into believing that our sole purpose on this earth is to be happy? Doesn&#x2019;t this unwitting affection for happiness over sadness lead us to a one-sided life, to bliss without discomfort, bright noon with no night? <br>My sense is that most of us have been duped by the American craze for happiness. We might think that we&#x2019;re leading a truly honest existence, one attuned to vivid realities and blooded hearts, when we&#x2019;re really just behaving as predictably and artificially as robots, falling easily into well-worn &#x201c;happy&#x201d; behaviors, into the conventions of contentment, into obvious grins. Deceived, we miss out on the great interplay of the living cosmos, its luminous gloom, its terrible beauty. <br>The American dream might be a nightmare. What passes for bliss could well be a dystopia of flaccid grins. Our passion for felicity hints at an ominous hatred for all that grows and thrives and then dies&#x2014;for all those curious thru...</p><h2>Golgo 13, Vol. 11 (11)</h2><p>1996: Okinawa, Japan&#39;s smallest prefecture, holds 75 percent of the U.S. military presence in Japan. When a Self-Defense Force officer is murdered by his associates, Golgo steps into the ominous discontent behind one of Japan&#39;s greatest controversies! Then, it&#39;s known that Golgo 13 will kill anyone who tries to impersonate him. But if you&#39;re merely mistaken for him by a Chicago crime boss, can you possibly escape alive? Plus FILE 13 brings you part two of an extensive interview with creator Takao Saito!</p><p>Takao Saito was born in Osaka on November 3, 1936. Ten years younger than Osamu Tezuka (Phoenix, Adolf: A Tale of the Twentieth Century), Saito grew up reading him as part of Japan's own first postwar generation of manga fans. In the 1950s and 60s, however, Saito and his peers such as Yoshihiro Tatsumi (The Push Man &amp; Other Stories) began to find an artistic voice of their own, creating adult-oriented graphic novels and magazine stories for the gekiga ("drama pictures") movement, whose name set itself apart from "manga"--a term then still associated only with works suitable for children.<br><br>Gekiga style gradually made itself respected within the manga industry as a whole, and by 1965 Takao Saito was well-known enough to be asked to create the authorized manga adaptation of Ian Fleming's original James Bond novels, an experience that prepared him well for Saito's own creation, Golgo 13, a ruthless secret agent out not for his country, but for himself: a reflection of the darkening era of Vietnam, political assassinations, and Watergate. Since its premiere in the January 1969 issue of Big Comic magazine (home of Viz's multiple Eisner-award nominated Eagle), Golgo 13 has remained topical, growing into a phenomenon even by manga standards, with 137 volumes in Japan to date and total sales of well over 200 million.<br><br><b>A longtime publisher as well as an artist, Takao Saito formed his own production company in 1960, that by 1974 developed into Leed Co. Ltd, which continues today to put out its own line of manga, books, and contemporary-interest magazines. Leed was itself an early pioneer of the American manga market, in 1986 releasing its own four-volume English-language edition of Golgo 13 graphic novels for distribution in the U.S.--a full year before American companies began to publish manga on a regular basis in comic book format, and more than fifteen years before the Japanese graphic novel format would become standard in the U.S. manga industry.<br></b></p><h2>Averroes: On the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy (Gibb Memorial Trust)</h2><p>In this treatise Ibn Rushd (Averroes) sets out to show that the Scriptural Law (shar&#39;) of Islam does not altogether prohibit the study of philosophy by Muslims, but, on the contrary, makes it a duty for a certain class of people, those with the capacity for &#34;demonstrative&#34; or scientific reasoning. Apparent conflicts between the teachings of Scripture and philosophy can be reconciled by allegorical interpretations of Scripture, though such interpretations should not be taught to the common people.

The tale of Charles Edward Stuart, "Bonnie Prince Charlie," and his heroic attempt to regain his grandfather's (James II) crown--remains the stuff of legend: the hunted fugitive, Flora MacDonald, and the dramatic escape over the sea to the Isle of Skye. But the full story--the real history--is even more dramatic, captivating, and revelatory.</p><p>Much more than a single rebellion, the events of 1745 were part of an ongoing civil war that threatened to destabilize the British nation and its empire. The Bonnie Prince and his army alone could not have posed a great threat. But with the involvement of Britain's perennial enemy, Catholic France, it was a far more dangerous and potentially catastrophic situation for the British crown. With encouragement and support from Louis XV, Charles&#x2019;s triumphant Jacobite army advanced all the way to Derby, a mere 120 miles from London, before a series of missteps ultimately doomed the rebellion to crushing defeat and annihilation at Culloden in April 1746--the last battle ever fought on British soil.</p><p>Jacqueline Riding conveys the full weight of these monumental years of English and Scottish history as the future course of Great Britain as a united nation was irreversibly altered.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Jacqueline Riding</b> specializes in eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century British history and art.

There is Yossi, a young man who, though deeply attached to the Hasidic culture in which he was raised, longed for a life with fewer restrictions and more tolerance. Yossi's efforts at making such a life, however, were being severely hampered by his fourth grade English and math skills, his profound ignorance of the ways of the outside world, and the looming threat that pursuing his desires would almost certainly lead to rejection by his family and friends. Then she met Dini, a young wife and mother whose decision to deviate even slightly from Hasidic standards of modesty led to threatening phone calls from anonymous men, warning her that she needed to watch the way she was dressing if she wanted to remain a part of the community. Someone else introduced Winston to Steinmetz, a closet bibliophile worked in a small Judaica store in his community and spent his days off anxiously evading discovery in the library of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary, whose shelves contain non-Hasidic books he is forbidden to read but nonetheless devours, often several at a sitting. There were others still who had actually made the wrenching decision to leave their communities altogether. <br><i><br></i>In her new Preface, Winston discusses the passionate reactions the book has elicited among Hasidim and non-Hasidim alike.<br><br><b>Named one of <i>Publishers Weekly</i>'s Ten Best Religion Books of 2005.<br><b>Honorable Mention in the 2012 Casey Medals for Meritorious Journalism</b></b></p><p>Hella Winston is pursuing her Ph.D. in sociology at the Graduate Center for the City University of New York. She lives in New York City.<i>Starred Review.</i> While other excellent studies by Sue Fishkoff, Stephanie Wellen-Levine and Lis Harris have examined the inner lives of Lubavitcher Hasidim in a mostly positive way, this account distinguishes itself by focusing on the "rebels," not just among the Lubavitch but in other Hasidic communities as well, including the insular and right-wing Satmar sect. Winston, a doctoral candidate in sociology at CUNY, unfolds a world-within-a-world, where some young Hasidim sneak televisions into their apartments in garbage bags, change clothes on the subway to frequent bars in Manhattan and blog about their double lives online. She builds fascinating case studies, inviting readers into her interviewees' conflicted, and often painful, lives. One chapter profiles a famous Hasidic teacher who in fact no longer believes; another offers a walking tour of a Hasidic <i>'chood</i> (slang for neighborhood); and another chronicles the hopeful and inspiring story of Malkie, a college-age woman who is building a sort of halfway house for others, like her, who have chosen to leave Hasidism. Winston shows us a Hasidic underworld where large families and a lack of secular education have resulted in extreme poverty and some serious at-risk behavior among youth. Her story of courage and intellectual rebellion will inspire anyone who has ever felt like a religious outcast. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The work is a careful, well-documented study of nationalism and ethnic prejudice, and chronicles the power and violence of these two ideas in American society from 1860 to 1925. He significantly moves beyond previous treatments of nativism, both in chronology and in interpretive sophistication. Higham defines nativism as a defensive type of nationalism or an intense opposition to an internal minority on the grounds of the group's foreign connections. By defining nativism as a set of attitudes or a state of mind, he sets the course for his book as tracing "trace an emotionally charged impulse" rather than "an actual social process or condition." As he argues that the ideological content of nativism remained consistent, he uses emotional intensity as a measure to trace in detail public opinion from the relative calm following the Civil War to the Johnson-Reed act of 1924 that severely limited European immigration.<br><br> Strangers in the Land is, then, a history of public opinion, whose purpose is to show how nativism evolved in society and in action. Higham seeks to explain what could inflame xenophobia and who resisted it. He saw his work as part of a renewed interest in the study of nationalism following the national upheavals in the wake of the McCarthy hearings. Surely Higham's mentor at the University of Wisconsin, intellectual historian Merle Curti, influenced Higham's approach in seeking to examine the power of nationalism as an idea. Also influential was the intellectual climate of the 1950s with its of distrust of ideology and distain of prejudice. Higham admits being repelled by the nationalist delusions of the Cold War, again helping to explain why his study concentrates on seeking some explanation for the irrational and violent outbreaks. The book thus focuses on points of conflict, "antagonisms that belong within ideologies of passionate national consciousness." For example, Higham's explains the 100 percent American movement in terms of progressive ideals and the desire of Americans to shape immigrants into a particular ideal of "Americanness" through education and assimilation. This intellectual construct eventually gave way to the racial thinking to which Higham assigns much influence in the efforts to restrict immigration. Ideology is also central to his chapter on the history of the idea of racism in which he argues that Anglo-Saxon nationalism, literary naturalism and a nascent understanding of genetics combined to bring forth arguments for immigration restriction to preserve the racial purity of the American people. Thus, key for Higham's argument is the power of ideas in shaping individual behavior and thereby shaping history.<br><br> This text is an absolute must-read for anyone seeking to understand American nativism and the darker side of nationalism.</p><p>In June 2005, John Higham quit his job as a rocket scientist, and along with his wife (who also quit her job), packed up their home and for the next 52 weeks visited 29 countries on five continents, and crossed 24 time zones.</p><h2>Revolutionary Conceptions: Women, Fertility, and Family Limitation in America, 1760-1820 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early American ... and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>In the Age of Revolution, how did American women conceive their lives and marital obligations? By examining the attitudes and behaviors surrounding the contentious issues of family, contraception, abortion, sexuality, beauty, and identity, Susan E. Klepp demonstrates that many women--rural and urban, free and enslaved--began to radically redefine motherhood. They asserted, or attempted to assert, control over their bodies, their marriages, and their daughters' opportunities.<br><br>Late-eighteenth-century American women were among the first in the world to disavow the continual childbearing and large families that had long been considered ideal. Liberty, equality, and heartfelt religion led to new conceptions of virtuous, rational womanhood and responsible parenthood. These changes can be seen in falling birthrates, in advice to friends and kin, in portraits, and in a gradual, even reluctant, shift in men's opinions. Revolutionary-era women redefined femininity, fertility, family, and their futures by limiting births. Women might not have won the vote in the new Republic, they might not have gained formal rights in other spheres, but, Klepp argues, there was a women's revolution nonetheless.<br><br></p><p>"Klepp's adept use of quantitative data and visual imagery makes the fertility transition real in cultural as well as demographic terms. We see the transformation in the representations of women's bodies and calculate the shift in numbers of births. Her knowledge of the evidence is unsurpassed, and she presents her finding with clarity and insight."--Kathleen M. Brown, University of Pennsylvania <br>By examining the attitudes and behaviors surrounding the contentious issues of family, contraception, abortion, sexuality, beauty, and identity, Klepp demonstrates that many American women--rural and urban, free and enslaved--began to radically redefine motherhood during the Age of Revolution as they asserted, or attempted to assert, control over their bodies, their marriages, and their daughters&#39; opportunities.</p><h2>The Wisdom of Heschel</h2><p><p>"Philosophy may be defined as the art of asking the right questions...Awareness of the problem outlives all solutions. The answers are questions in disguise, every new answer giving rise to new questions." This example of Rabbi Heschel's thought and manner of expression, familiar to the readers of his many books, serves as an epigraph to The Wisdom of Heschel.</p><p>As Ruth Goodhill says in her foreword, "These selections from the works of the prophetic giant of the twentieth century, Abraham Joshua Heschel, represent my personal response to his writings. This book, conceived during his lifetime, is offered as an introduction to his thought and to his profound understanding of the agonies of modern society."</p><p>Most of the selections are taken from God in Search of Man, The Insecurity of Freedom, Man Is Not Alone, The Sabbath, The Prophets, and Who Is Man? Among the categories in which the excerpts have been grouped are "Questions Man Asks, " "Man's Needs, " "Caring for Our Old, " "Teaching Our Young, " "Law, "" The Sabbath, " and "One World."</p></p><p><p><b>Abraham Joshua Heschel</b> was internationally known as a scholar, author, activist, and theologian. He was Professor of Ethics and Mysticism at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.</p>The Wisdom of Heschel <br> <i>Questions Man Asks</i> WHAT IS THE meaning of my being? ... My quest--man's quest--is not for theoretical knowledge about myself ... What I look for is not how to gain a firm hold on myself and on life, but primarily how to live a life that would deserve and evoke an eternal Amen. IT IS NOT ENOUGH for me to be able to say "I am"; I want to know who <i>I</i> am, and in relation to whom I live. It is not enough for me to ask questions; I want to know how to answer the one question that seems to encompass everything I face: What am I here for? IT IS NOT ONLY the question of how to justify our own existence but, above all, how to justify bringing human beings into the world. If human existence is absurd and miserable, why give birth to children? DO WE BUILD cities in order to supply ruins for the archaeologists of a later age? Do we rear children in order to prepare ashes for the outcome of nuclear wars? THE IMPERATIVE according to the logic of biology may be: "Eat, drink, and be merry!" Yet a life essentially dedicated to the fulfillment of such an imperative results in depriving human being of all the qualities of being human. WHY BE CONCERNED with meaning? Why not be content with satisfaction of desires and needs? The vital drives of food, sex, and power, as well as the mental functions aimed at satisfying them, are as characteristic of animals as they are of man. Being human is a characteristic of a being who faces the question: <i>After satisfaction, what?</i> MAN CANNOT RESTRAIN his bitter yearning to know whether life is nothing but a series of momentary physiological and mental processes, actions, and forms of behavior, a flow of vicissitudes, desires, and sensations, running like grains through an hourglass, marking time only once and always vanishing ... Is life nothing but an agglomeration of facts, unrelated to one another--chaos camouflaged by illusion? MAN CANNOT be understood in his own terms. He can only be understood in terms of a larger context. Our problem, now, is: What is the context of man, in terms of which he can be ultimately understood? TO BE HUMAN is to be involved, to act and to react, to wonder and to respond. For man, to be is to play a part in a cosmic drama, knowingly or unknowingly ... Man's most important problem is not being but living. To live means to be at the crossroads. There are many forces and drives within the self. What direction to take is a question we face again and again. Who am I? A mere chip from the block of being? Am I not both the chisel and the marble? Being and foreseeing? Being and bringing into being? <i>Copyright @ 1970, 1972, 1975 by Sylvia Heschel, Executrix of the Estate of Abraham Joshua Heschel</i></p><h2>My Once and Future Duke: The Wagers of Sin (The Wagers of Sin, 1)</h2><p><p><strong><em>What happens at the infamous Vega Club . . .</em></strong></p><p>Sophie Campbell is determined to be mistress of her own fate.

Here, Heidegger openly resumes thinking that deeply engaged him with H�lderlin's poetry and themes developed in his earlier works. In the Freiburg lectures Heidegger ponders thought itself and freely engages with the German idealists and Greek thinkers who had provoked him in the past. Andrew J.

He appears regularly on EWTN with Scott Hahn.<b>Introduction<br>The Mass Is What We Do</b><br><br>The Mass is what Catholics do. It&#x2019;s the heart of Catholic life, for individuals and for the community. <br><br>A Catholic may fill up hours with devotional prayers and volunteer service, public witness, and almsgiving. <br><br>A parish may sponsor a school and a soup kitchen, a scouting troop and several Bible study groups.<br><br>The Mass, however, is the heart that gives life to all of it. Our tradition describes the Mass beautifully as &#x201c;the source and summit of the whole Christian life.&#x201d; Catholicism means many things to the world. It has inspired the art and architecture of the great masters. Our sanctuaries have echoed with masterworks of music. Our saints have served the poorest of the poor. Yet all these things we trace back to a single source: the Mass.<br><br>Catholics think of the Mass as synonymous with the parish church. Whether we say &#x201c;I went to church&#x201d; or &#x201c;I went to Mass,&#x201d; we mean the same thing. Even if we do many other things at our church, the Mass is what the building was made for. To &#x201c;go to church&#x201d; is to go to Mass. This is true for every Catholic. When the pope travels to distant lands, the news media pay close attention&#x2014; and the world watches as he simply does what Catholics do: he celebrates<br>Mass, sometimes for a congregation of hundreds of thousands of people.<br><br>Yet such a large-scale event is no greater than the usual Mass in an ordinary parish. It is the same, in its essence, as<br>a Mass that a military chaplain offers on the hood of a Jeep during a lull in a battle.<br><br>The Mass is the most familiar and recognizable element of the Catholic faith; and still it is also the most enigmatic. In the Mass we see postures, gestures, and items of clothing that would seem out of place anywhere else. We hear words that hint at deep and ancient mysteries. Even the more familiar words sometimes mean something quite different<br>from their meaning in ordinary usage.<br><br>The words, the vestments, and the gestures of the Mass took their origins in times long past. Nevertheless, they hold infinite meaning for Catholics today. For we believe that the Son of God took flesh and became man in a particular time and place, and that he used the language and culture of that time and place to convey truths that speak to every age and nation. Jesus insisted on this point; and so, &#x201c;on the night he was handed over, took bread, and, after he had given thanks, broke it and said, &#x2018;This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.&#x2019; In the same way also the cup, after supper, saying, &#x2018;This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.&#x2019; For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes&#x201d; (1 Corinthians 11:23&#x2013;26).<br><br>He said, &#x201c;Do this,&#x201d; and so <i>this &#x2014;</i> the Mass &#x2014; is what we Catholics do.<br><br>We find the experience more rewarding, however, when we understand the Mass as we pray it. And that&#x2019;s the reason<br>for this book.<br><br>In the chapters that follow, we&#x2019;ll look at all the elements that go together to make up a typical Mass. We&#x2019;ll define some basic terms. We&#x2019;ll outline the parts of the ritual. We&#x2019;ll look at each and every part from up close. We&#x2019;ll examine the prayers. We&#x2019;ll discuss the vessels and the vestments used in the ritual. We&#x2019;ll speak a bit about doctrine. We&#x2019;ll trace some prayers and practices back to their historical and biblical roots. We&#x2019;ll take a slow walk through the Mass, stopping to see the sights along the way.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not a very original idea, we acknowledge. Saint Cyril of Jerusalem and Saint Ambrose of Milan produced such<br>books in the fourth century. Great saints have followed suit. In the last century, many more such books appeared, from authors as great as Monsignor Ronald Knox and Archbishop Fulton Sheen.<br><br>Why do Catholics need new books to go over the same ground? Saint Augustine addressed God as a truth &#x201c;ever ancient and ever new.&#x201d; The prayers and signs do come to us from venerable antiquity, and they remain basically the same. Yet some details change, as the rites make their home in different times and cultures. We&#x2019;ve changed, and so our experience of the Mass has changed. It&#x2019;s time for us to take a fresh look, from where we sit now&#x2014;and from where we stand and kneel.</p><h2>My Life as a Night Elf Priest: An Anthropological Account of World of Warcraft (Technologies of the Imagination: New Media in Everyday Life)</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p><p>"Ever since the creators of the animated television show <i>South Park</i> turned their lovingly sardonic gaze on the massively multiplayer online game <i>World of Warcraft</i> for an entire episode, <i>WoW</i>'s status as an icon of digital culture has been secure. <i>My Life as a Night Elf Priest</i> digs deep beneath the surface of that icon to explore the rich particulars of the <i>World of Warcraft</i> player's experience."<br> &#x2014;Julian Dibbell, <i>Wired</i></p> <p></p> <p>"<i>World of Warcraft</i> is the best representative of a significant new technology, art form, and sector of society: the theme-oriented virtual world.

At his death in 2010, he left behind an unfinished manuscript, more than a decade in the making, intended as a summation of his life-long engagement with one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most influential philosophical tracts, Heidegger&#x2019;s <i>Being and Time</i> (1927). <i>Dasein Disclosed</i> brings together in a single volume the writings of a man widely acknowledged as one of Heidegger&#x2019;s preeminent and most provocative interpreters.</p><p>A labyrinth of notoriously difficult ideas and terminology, <i>Being and Time</i> has inspired copious commentary. Not content merely to explain, Haugeland aspired to a sweeping reevaluation of Heidegger&#x2019;s magnum opus and its conception of human life as <i>Dasein</i>&#x2015;a reevaluation focused on Heidegger&#x2019;s effort to reawaken philosophically dormant questions of what it means &#x201c;to be.&#x201d; Interpreting <i>Dasein</i> unconventionally as &#x201c;the living of a living way of life,&#x201d; Haugeland put involvement in a shared world, rather than individual persons or their experience, at the heart of Heidegger&#x2019;s phenomenology of understanding and truth. Individuality, Haugeland insists, emerges in the call to take responsibility for a collective way of being in the world. He traces this thought to Heidegger&#x2019;s radical conclusion that one does not truly understand philosophical concepts unless that understanding changes how one lives.</p><p>As illuminating as it is iconoclastic, <i>Dasein Disclosed</i> is not just Haugeland&#x2019;s Heidegger&#x2015;it is a major contribution to philosophy in its own right.</p></p><p><p>John Haugeland was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago.</p><p>Joseph Rouse is Professor of Philosophy at Wesleyan University.</p>&#x201c;<b>John Haugeland</b> was well known among philosophers as an ingenious interpreter of Martin Heidegger&#x2019;s <i>Being and Time</i>. Central to his reading of that difficult text was his denial of what had seemed obvious to most other readers: that Heidegger&#x2019;s word <i>Dasein</i> (which in ordinary German just means existence) refers to the individual human being... When he died in 2010 he had been working for years on what was to be the definitive statement of his alternative interpretation. The envisioned opus was to be called <i>Dasein Disclosed</i>, and the unfinished manuscript forms the central hundred pages or so of the present volume, which now bears that title. It has been edited with great intelligence and care by <b>Joseph Rouse</b>... Haugeland&#x2019;s innovation is to insist that an individual human being&#x2019;s existence is just part of a larger phenomenon, what he calls &#x2018;a living way of life,&#x2019; and that this (not <i>person</i> or <i>human being</i>) is what Heidegger meant by <i>Dasein</i>... Haugeland&#x2019;s reading of <i>Being and Time</i> is philosophically deep and original in its own right... For like Heidegger&#x2019;s own&#x2015;often violent&#x2015;treatments of other thinkers, <i>Dasein Disclosed</i> is best read not as exegesis or commentary, but as a kind of creative dialogue. An interpretation, after all, sometimes sheds light on a text not by coinciding with it, but by straying from it and illuminating the space between them.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Taylor Carman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>John Haugeland</b> was not able to complete the book detailing his master reading of the constructive portions of Heidegger's <i>Sein und Zeit</i>, but the present book is as close as we can get. <i>Dasein Disclosed</i> is the deepest and most interesting work on Heidegger in a generation. It will be invaluable to all who care about the topic--not only Heidegger specialists, but also those working in the analytic tradition who care about the philosophical issues Haugeland's <i>Heidegger </i>addresses.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert B.

Haugeland's work on Heidegger is especially valuable owing to his stature within analytic circles--if anyone can get analytic philosophers to take Heidegger seriously, Haugeland is the one to do so.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David R. Cerbone, West Virginia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>John Haugeland</b> was one of the most creative and acute philosophers of his generation. <b>Joseph Rouse</b>'s careful edition of Haugeland's writings on Heidegger--including his incomplete, yet fascinating, commentary on <i>Being and Time</i>--provides a comprehensive view of one of the great philosophical encounters of recent times. Anyone interested in issues in metaphysics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of mind will benefit from Haugeland's meticulous, clear, and original interpretations of Heidegger's revolutionary ideas--interpretations in which Haugeland's own genius is everywhere apparent.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steven Crowell, Rice University</b><br><br>&#x201c;It was <b>John Haugeland</b>'s lifelong project to unveil Heidegger's philosophy to Anglo-American sensibilities. In this volume his profound interpretation finally comes fully into view. Manifesting the brilliance, depth, and care for which Haugeland is renowned in the philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence, <i>Dasein Disclosed</i> deftly reveals the rigorous standards to which he has always held accounts of self, mind, and intentionality. An immense gift, not just for Heidegger scholars, but for all students of philosophy and mind.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Brian Cantwell Smith, University of Toronto</b></p><h2>Tea with Oliver</h2><p><strong>An Amazon Best Children's Book of the Month selection</strong><p><strong>Filled with humor and heart and brought to life with gorgeous watercolor-and-ink illustrations, this book from debut author-illustrator Mika Song shows readers how friends can come in all shapes and sizes and be found in the most unexpected places.</strong></p><p>Oliver is not like other cats.

My personal experiences with using herbs when I wanted to have a child and unknowingly prevented pregnancy for 7 years. I was very upset and thought I was barren for years. I already had 3 children and it depressed me that I was unable to have any more. This information can help other women space their children apart if they have access to different herbs. For thousands of years, ancient cultures have used herbs to bring on a women&#39;s period. It took years to figure out that women who want to get pregnant should avoid these herbs as well. Many people needlessly seek fertility treatments when maybe they are preventing pregnancy with a favorite herbal tea they drink daily. Others want to space their children or prevent pregnancy at times when they are not ready for a child. Both times are important in every life of every woman from the time we become women. I wrote this book several years ago but I was hesitant to publish it at the time. With the current world conditions of women around the world I hope this book helps many who need this information. My daughter just told me that they are teaching girls about reproduction in school right now and so this information is important for young girls all over the world who are confused about how to protect their reproductive health and still stay true to themselves and any child they may have in Heaven waiting to be born. God bless women and their children all over the world. May we see past race, color, national origin, religion, and any other differences that may tend to divide. We are simply women with the same human conditions. We must help each other and hold each other up. We must educate each other on the subjects we know and can testify to and share the knowledge with the world while we have the chance to share it.</p><p></p><h2>The Chickamauga Campaign&#x2015;Barren Victory: The Retreat into Chattanooga, the Confederate Pursuit, and the Aftermath of the Battle, September 21 to October 20, 1863</h2><p>"Now in paperback, Barren Victory is the third and concluding volume of the magisterial Chickamauga Campaign trilogy, a comprehensive examination of one of the most important and complex military operations of the Civil War.<br><br>The first installment, A Mad Irregular Battle, introduced readers to the major characters of this sweeping drama and carried them from the Union crossing of the Tennessee River in August 1863 up through the bloody but inconclusive combat of the first and second days of the battle (September 18 and 19, 1863). Glory or the Grave, the second volume, focused on September 20&#x2014;the decisive third day of fighting that included the Confederate late-morning breakthrough and the desperate Union final stand on Horseshoe Ridge. This installment drew to a close at nightfall. Powell&#x2019;s final installment, Barren Victory, examines the immediate aftermath of the battle with unprecedented clarity and detail.<br><br>The narrative opens at dawn on Monday, September 21, 1863, with Union commander William S. Rosecrans in Chattanooga and most of the rest of his Federal army in Rossville, Georgia. Confederate commander Braxton Bragg has won the signal victory of his career, but has yet to fully grasp that fact or the fruits of his success. Unfortunately for the South, the three grueling days of combat broke down the Army of Tennessee and a vigorous pursuit was nearly impossible.<br><br>In addition to carefully examining the decisions made by each army commander and the consequences, Powell sets forth the dreadful costs of the fighting in terms of the human suffering involved. Barren Victory concludes with the most detailed Chickamauga orders of battle (including unit strengths and losses) ever compiled, and a comprehensive bibliography more than a decade in the making.<br><br>David Powell&#x2019;s award-winning The Chickamauga Campaign trilogy is now complete. The fighting in the hills and valleys of North Georgia has finally received the extensive treatment it has so long deserved."</p><p>David A. Powell is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute (1983) with a BA in history. He has published numerous articles in various magazines, and more than fifteen historical simulations of different battles. For the past decade, David&#x2019;s focus has been on the epic battle of Chickamauga, and he is nationally recognized for his tours of that important battlefield. The results of that study are the volumes The Maps of Chickamauga (2009) and Failure in the Saddle (2010), as well as The Chickamauga Campaign trilogy. The Chickamauga Campaign: A Mad Irregular Battle was published in 2014, The Chickamauga Campaign: Glory or the Grave appeared in September 2015, and the final volume, Barren Victory, was released in September 2016. David and his wife Anne live and work in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. He is Vice President of Airsped, Inc., a specialized delivery firm."Dave Powell concludes his award-winning Chickamauga trilogy with the appropriately titled Barren Victory. The post-battle coverage is simply unprecedented among prior Chickamauga studies, ranging from graphic eyewitness descriptions of the battlefield&#x2019;s horrors to in-depth consideration of the outcome&#x2019;s strategic and political implications. Powell seamlessly weaves the stories of the campaign&#x2019;s large cast of characters together, including full discussions of Braxton Bragg&#x2019;s limited options and the complex relationship between Rosecrans, Garfield, and Dana. But Powell goes beyond the leaders to argue persuasively that Chickamauga was &#x201c;the quintessential soldiers&#x2019; battle.&#x201d; Detailed orders of battle, including strengths and losses down to the regimental level for both armies, conclude Powell&#x2019;s comprehensive analysis. Every enthusiast of the American Civil War&#x2019;s Western Theater will want this essential final volume of Dave Powell&#x2019;s series in their personal library.&#x201d;" (James A.

Dave Powell&#x2019;s three-volume work on the Chickamauga Campaign represents the most significant Western campaign contribution since Albert Castel&#x2019;s Decision in the West.

S. Shuckburgh. Written in the second century A.D., these writings encapsulate the wisdom and ability possessed by their author. Already well into maturity, it is here that the accumulated experience of a man who had - in an illustrious career of public service in the Roman Empire - seen and known all manner of events and people in his bustling society. The attributes important to friendship are identified by Cicero as he discusses the qualities a good friend should have. There are several intractable virtues of friendship, which must be preserved lest the union be damaged. The second treatise elaborates upon what it is to be old. Writing so as to echo the much esteemed Cato the Elder, the beauty and profundity of the words in this essay are significant.

A number of those essays have been collected in this slim, though far from slight, tome. In his columns, Zinsser tackled the arts, technology, and travel, among other topics, often ruminating on the ways in which American society today is far poorer culturally than in the heyday decades of his youth. Yet Zinsser, an acolyte of E. B. White, is no Andy Rooney&#x2013;style crank; he&#x2019;s simply a gentle soul longing for gentler times, doing his best to hold true to values no longer valued. Not surprisingly for the author of the essential text On Writing Well, Zinsser is at his best when commenting on his chosen profession. Writers can write to affirm and to celebrate, or they can write to debunk and destroy; the choice is ours, he cautions students of the craft. For his part, Zinsser has decided to affirm. --Patty Wetli</p><h2>The Flight of Icarus: Novel (New Directions Books)</h2><p><p><strong>The Flight of Icarus (Le Vol d'lcare) is his only novel written in the form of a play: seventy-four short scenes, complete with stage directions.</strong></p> Called by some the French Borges, by others the creator of le nouveau roman a generation ahead of its time, Raymond Queneau's work in fiction continues to defy strict categorization. The Flight of Icarus (Le Vol d'lcare) is his only novel written in the form of a play: seventy-four short scenes, complete with stage directions. Consciously parodying Pirandello and Robbe-Grillet, it begins with a novelist's discovery that his principal character, Icarus by name, has vanished. This, in turn, sets off a rash of other such disappearances. Before long, a number of desperate authors are found in search of their fugitive characters, who wander through the Paris of the 1890s, occasionally meeting one another, and even straying into new novels. Icarus himself&#x2013;&#x2013;perhaps following the destiny his name suggests&#x2013;&#x2013;develops a passion for horseless carriages, kites, and machines that fly. And throughout the almost vaudevillian turns of the plot, we are aware, as always, of Queneau's evident delight at holding the thin line between farce and philosophy.</p><p>The Flight of Icarus is Raymond Queneau&#39;s only novel written in the form of a play: seventy-four short scenes, complete with stage directions.

As a sideman, Hendrix played with the likes of Little Richard, Ike and Tina Turner, the Isley Brothers, and Sam &amp; Dave&#x2014;but none knew what to make of his spotlight-stealing rock guitar experimentation, the likes of which had never been heard before.&nbsp;From 1962 to 1966, on the rough and tumble club circuit, Hendrix learned to please a crowd, deal with racism, and navigate shady music industry characters, all while evolving his own astonishing style. Finally, in New York&#x2019;s Greenwich Village, two key women helped him survive, and his discovery in a tiny basement club in 1966 led to Hendrix instantly being heralded as a major act in Europe before he returned to America, appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival, and entered the pantheon of rock&#x2019;s greatest musicians.&nbsp;<i>Becoming Jimi Hendrix</i> is based on over one hundred interviews with those who knew Hendrix best during his lean years, more than half of whom have never spoken about him on the record. Utilizing court transcripts, FBI files, private letters, unpublished photos, and U.S. Army documents, this is the story of a young musician who overcame enormous odds, a past that drove him to outbursts of violence, and terrible professional and personal decisions that complicated his life before his untimely demise.</p><p><b>Steven Roby</b> wrote <i>Black Gold: The Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix</i>.

An Aborigine artist, a Holocaust survivor, a beatific washerwoman, and a childlike heiress are each blessed&#x2014;and stricken&#x2014;with visionary experiences that may or may not allow them to transcend the machinations of their fellow men. Tender and lacerating, pure and profane, subtle and sweeping, <i>Riders in the Chariot</i> is one of the Nobel Prize winner's boldest books.</p><p>Patrick White (1912-1990) was born in London and traveled to Sydney with his Australian parents six months later. White was a solitary, precocious, asthmatic child and at thirteen was sent to an English boarding school, a miserable experience. At eighteen he returned to Australia and worked as a jackaroo on an isolated sheep station. Two years later, he went up to Cambridge, settling afterwards in London, where he published his first two books. White joined the&nbsp;RAF&nbsp;in 1940 and served as an intelligence officer in the Middle East. At war&#x2019;s end, he and his partner, Manoly Lascaris, bought an old house in a Sydney suburb, where they lived with their four Schnauzers. For the next eighteen years, the two men farmed their six acres while White worked on some of his finest novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Tree of Man</i>(1955),&nbsp;<i>Voss</i>&nbsp;(1957), and&nbsp;<i>Riders in the Chariot</i>&nbsp;(1961). When he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1973, he did not attend the ceremony but, with his takings and some of his own money, created an award to help older writers who hadn&#x2019;t received their due: the first recipient was Christina Stead. Late in life, when asked for a list of his loves, White responded: &#x201c;Silence, the company of friends, unexpected honesty, reading, going to the pictures, dreams, uncluttered landscapes, city streets, faces, good food, cooking small meals, whisky, sex, pugs, the thought of an Australian republic, my ashes floating off at last.&#x201d;<br><br>David Malouf is a novelist and poet. His novel&nbsp;<i>The Great World</i>was awarded the Commonwealth Prize and&nbsp;<i>Remembering Babylon</i>&nbsp;was short-listed for the Booker Prize. He has received the&nbsp;IMPAC&nbsp;Dublin Literary Award and the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times</i>Book Award. He lives in Sydney, Australia.A poetically vivid narrative...It is a finely written novel with a rare flavor.<br>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<br></i><br><i>Riders in the Chariot</i>&nbsp;is the most compassionate and the most beautiful of all Patrick White&#x2019;s works; colours fly everywhere; his words, comic, ecstatic, are like the brushstrokes on a canvas by Nolan or Blake.<br>&#x2014; Carmen Callil and Colm T�ib�n,&nbsp;<i>The Modern Library: The 200 Best Novels in English Since 1950</i><br><br>Patrick White is an outsider, and his characters are outsiders, outlaws, afflicted, and linked by their affliction. The visionary element in his novels is inseparable from a tough irony and a microscopically close, sometimes savage attention to physical minutiae. The coarser the texture of the physical&#x2014;of bodies especially&#x2014;the more likely to be illuminated by flashes of meaning and power.<br>&#x2014; Rosemary Dinnage</p><h2>Free Enterprise: A Novel of Mary Ellen Pleasant</h2><p><p>In 1858, two black women meet at a restaurant and begin to plot a revolution. Mary Ellen Pleasant owns a string of hotels in San Francisco that secretly double as havens for runaway slaves. Her comrade, Annie, is a young Jamaican who has given up her life of privilege to fight for the abolitionist cause. Together they join John Brown's doomed enterprise and barely escape with their lives. With mesmerizing skill, Cliff weaves a multitude of voices into a gripping, poignant story of the struggle for liberation that began not long after the first slaves landed on America's shores.</p><p>"Cliff's extraordinary novel loosely based on the life of Mary Ellen Pleasant and a Jamaican woman named Annie Christmas . . . The tale of Mary Ellen and Annie is told obliquely, through lyrical fragments, letters, and associative incidents, all part of Cliff's effort to 'adjust the lens' in her fiction, as she calls it, to 'bring the background into relief, blurring the more familiar foreground.'"&#x2014;<em>Village Voice Literary Supplement</em></p><p>"Free Enterprise is an angry, gaudy, multicultural storm of a historical novel . . . At the heart of this story are two African-American women, comrades of abolitionist John Brown . . . Michelle Cliff brings together a fabulous cast of outsiders...to retell New World history from the women warriors&#x2019; point of view."&#x2014;<em>Elle</em></p><p>"An articulate writer with an alluring prose style, Cliff offers and absorbing tale of friendship, survival and courage . . . Cliff skillfully weaves oral testaments, letters, poems, and colorful narrative to tell stories of French, English and Spanish enslavers, and the African, Chinese, Indian and Hawaiian people they persecuted. With prismatic prose, she limns the portraits of her two protagonists&#x2014;each with her own joys and troubles, who are bound by a common love for their people."&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p><p>"Michelle Cliff thickly wraps legend, fantasy and imagination around the bones of history in this gracefully written account of two spirited Black women whose lives and letters cross from their beginnings as supporters of John Brown's insurrection at Harper&#x2019;s Ferry through the end of the 19th century and a return to a small island off the coast of Massachusetts. There is way in which Michelle Cliff captures the air and heat of a place and brings it fully to life. Whether it's an August dinner party in post Civil War Boston or evening tales recounted at a Louisiana leper colony, or sailing on the Caribbean sea, Cliff makes us want to explore the tales of story tellers and the truths of her intriguing characters."&#x2014;Devorah Major, author of <em>Brown Glass Windows</em></p><p>"Like almost all innovative novels, Free Enterprise explores the question, 'What does it mean to read a book?' Michelle Cliff understands the power&#x2014;and the danger&#x2014;of the written word. In Free Enterprise, she invites all of us to escape from our own skins and to enter into the experiences of others. That's the price we sometimes must pay for our own freedom."&#x2014;<em>Santa Rosa Press Democrat</em></p><p>"In her latest novel (after Abeng), the Jamaican-born Cliff attempts to create a web of fantasy, historical fiction, and legend as she relates the story of two black women and their fight for abolition. this is recommended for collections developing African American literature . . . "&#x2014;<em>Library Journal</em></p><p>"Written with lyrical power, <em>Free Enterprise</em> is a novel whose beauty opens out from every level of its existence. Confident and visionary, its urgent social agenda&#x2014;as relevant today as in the time of the setting&#x2014;speaks with courage to the human struggle for justice and freedom. Bravo! For Michelle Cliff."&#x2014;Clarence Major, author of <em>Such Was the Season</em></p><p>"There are sections of this book so searing that they can only be compare to fire. <em>Free Enterprise</em> burns its images of slavery into your eyes and makes the world seem to shimmer with heat lightning. Free Enterprise, which has as its ambition the rescuing of the past from oblivion, succeeds and more than succeeds."&#x2014;Susan Fromberg Schaffer, author of <em>The Madness of a Seduced Woman</em></p><p><strong>Michelle Cliff</strong> is the author of <em>No Telephone to Heaven</em>, among other books of fiction and essays.</p></p><p><p>Michelle Cliff was born in Jamaica and is the author of two previous novels,&nbsp;<em>No Telephone to Heaven</em> and <em>Abeng;&nbsp;</em>a collection of short stories and two poetry collections. Her fiction, poetry and essays have appeared in numerous publications, including <em>Parnassus</em> and the <em>VLS</em>.</p>Ambitious writing undercut by an equally ambitious political agenda as Jamaican-born Cliff (Bodies of Water, 1990, etc.) reclaims the life of African-American Mary Ellen Pleasant, a co- conspirator in John Brown's ill-fated raid on Harpers Ferry. In prose that veers from the lyrical to the polemic, Cliff makes the story of Mary Ellen the centerpiece of a novel that's as much a reprise of the wrongs done to the historically oppressed- -blacks, Jews, native peoples, lepers--as to Clover Adams, wife of the famous Henry. Mary Ellen, the daughter of a daring sea-captain who'd escaped from slavery in Jamaica and a Gullah-speaking mother from the South who'd fled as a young child to Martha's Vineyard, mostly tells her own story in the form of letters written (if not sent) while traveling--letters to wealthy abolitionist Alice Hooper and fellow conspirator Annie Christmas. She recalls her parents; how she met Annie at an antislavery meeting in New England; how her chain of prosperous hotels in California provided not only shelter for runaway slaves but money for John Brown's raid; and how she barely escaped death when that raid failed. Annie Christmas, daughter of wealthy French freed slaves, who'd dedicated her life to revolution, adds to both the story and the political agenda with her own recollections. Now living in a cabin on the banks of the Mississippi in Louisiana, she has befriended the more symbolic than real inmates of the nearby leper sanitorium--including a descendant of Hawaiian ``feathered kings''; a woman, Rachel, whose family had fled the Spanish Inquisition for the New World; and a hill-woman from Kentucky who'd witnessed a brutal raid of runaway slaves. And to broaden the polemic, Clover Adams's tragic suicide is retold with a feminist slant that blames her father as well as Henry for her death. A potentially great story lost amid too many flights of lyricism and litanies of wrongs. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Their landmark magazine <i>Raw</i>, which first published artists such as Ben Katchor, Chris Ware, and Charles Burns, brought an avant-garde sensibility to comics and, along with Spiegelman's legendary graphic novel <i>Maus</i>, completely revolutionized the form. As art editor of the <i>New Yorker</i> since 1993, Mouly has remade the face of that venerable magazine with covers that capture the political and social upheavals of the last two decades, such as the black-on-black cover after 9/11 and the infamous Barack Obama fist-bump cartoon. Based on exclusive interviews with Mouly, Spiegelman, and a pantheon of comics artists&#x2014;including Dan Clowes, Barry Blitt, Anita Kunz, and Adrian Tomine&#x2014;<i>In Love with Art</i> is both an intimate portrait of Mouly and a rare, behind-the-scenes look at some of today's most iconic images.

Joshua Cohen has performed in-depth investigations into mirrors and navels to return with THE QUORUM, his first collection of short fiction. A set of ten stories, a set of dreams, and a long monologue, these are all first-person rants given over by the somehow alienated individuals seeking only a sympathetic hearing, all dealing with identity and religion as well as occupied with technical ideas of reliable narration and the structure of &#34;the mind&#39;s ear.&#34; From a review of a book about the Holocaust that&#39;s six-million blank pages to a suicide note from a young university student, from a letter home detailing an economy based on hair to a eulogy for a poem from a story narrated by three-hundred concubines to the title story about a group of people who interchange appearances, habits, proclivities and talents, THE QUORUM is a tightly-written, sensitive, and inevitably absurd take on the individual&#39;s lifelong quest to get someone, anyone, to listen.</p><p>Because we shouldn&#39;t believe in nations, because we have forsaken our traditions or our traditions have forsaken us, because only individuals matter to those who happen to be one ... because everyone has their own voice and we&#39;re all speaking at once, connected through a disconnect and yet still insisting on our fundamental differences, that we&#39;re special, marked by virtue of our sheer existence ... Because of all these paradoxes -- screaming into each other through any ear and enacting a love-death in the gray middle -- how can we truly expect to listen when we want only to be heard?

In this critical introduction S. J. McGrath offers not a comprehensive summary of Heidegger but a series of incisive takes on Heidegger's thought, leading readers to a point from which they can begin or continue their own relationship with him.</p><p>S. J. McGrath is assistant professor of philosophy atMemorial University of Newfoundland and the author ofThe Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy:Phenomenology for the Godforsaken.<b>Thomas Sheehan</b><br> &#x2014; Stanford University<br> "In this gracefully written text Sean McGrath provides a clear reading of Heidegger and an incisive critique of his ontology, ethics, politics, and theology. McGrath anchors his critique in two positions that Heidegger claimed to have surpassed &#x2014; classical metaphysics and Christian humanism. While it may not convince mainstream Heideggerians, this work opens a discussion that merits serious attention from postmetaphysical and postmodern thinkers."<br><br><b>Oliva Blanchette</b><br> &#x2014; Boston College<br> "In this remarkably lucid introduction to a philosopher notorious not only for radicalizing and obfuscating philosophical questioning but also for bringing it back to the radical question of being or not-being, McGrath uses both biographical and existential information and the writing of Heidegger himself, especially in its earlier stages, to illuminate where this preeminent philosopher of the twentieth century was coming from in his questioning and where he was trying to go."<br><br><b>William Desmond</b><br> &#x2014; Katholieke Universiteit Leuven<br> "This informed and informative book is an admirably compact and clear introduction to the essentials of Heidegger's thought. It will be very helpful for the beginner, and for the more advanced reader it offers an honorable critical interpretation. McGrath exhibits a sharp sense for the often-recessed religious preoccupations of Heidegger: out of sight is not quite out of mind, which sometimes leads to convoluted results in Heidegger's expressed thought. For the theological reader this book offers an exemplary critical engagement, attuned to Heidegger's religious equivocality and what remains hidden in the Heideggerian unsaid."</p><h2>Healing Prostate &amp; Testicular Cancer: The Gerson Way</h2><p><p>This booklet introduces Dr. Max Gerson and the foundation of the Gerson Therapy, that cancer and most chronic diseases are able to manifest in the body because of toxicity and nutritional deficiency.

Since 1965, David Spangler has worked clairvoyantly and intuitively with a group of non-physical beings from the inner worlds of spirit. They identified themselves as being part of an inner school whose purpose was to explore and develop a spiritual teaching around the process of incarnation. This teaching is intended to empower incarnate persons living in the physical world-individuals such as you and me-to lead lives of greater blessing and capacity and to be sources of blessing and service for the world as a whole. From 1970-1973, David was a co-director of the Findhorn Foundation Community in Northern Scotland. In 1974 he co-founded the Lorian Association, a non-profit spiritual educational organization, and continues to work with it today. David is also a Fellow of the Lindisfarne Association, a gathering of scientists, mathematicians, artists, spiritual and religious teachers, ecologists, and political scientists, all interested in promoting a new culture based on holistic and Gaian values.

He lives in Santa Clarit, California with his three kids.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;Dismayed when his mom asks him to play with his baby brother, Morton wishes that the tot could turn into something fun, like a kite, or better yet, a hulkingly huge, lime-green dragon. In a series of amusing illustrations, the boy imagines the activities that he and his new companion would share, followed by the less-than-fun results on the next spread. A walk seems like a great idea, but the page turn shows the creature flying off into the sky with Morton dangling from its leash. A basketball game might be enjoyable, until he realizes the impossibility of scoring against a wall of towering green flesh. Whistling together is also a bust, as the youngster ends up with toasted hair. Chastened, Morton banishes his imaginary playmate and races home to join his brother in the sandbox. The brief text, interspersed with wordless spreads, makes this offering a great choice for newly independent readers as well as for sharing aloud. The exuberant watercolor-and-charcoal cartoons take maximum advantage of the dragon's girth, and the images sprawl across the pages. The wacky elasticity, breezy hilarity, and unexpected perspectives in the art add a sense of mad motion. This book's theme will resonate with children, who will appreciate the jokes and identify with the mischievous protagonist and his unusual friend.<i>&#x2013;Marge Loch-Wouters, Menasha Public Library, WI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In his dream there was no earth, only a dark, empty sky, and beyond the sky, unimaginably vast, the crystalline firmament in which the stars shone brightly. No clouds obscured the stars, and yet there was lightning in the dream, lightning without thunder, random flashes of blinding light that illuminated great flocks of birds that suddenly filled the dark sky. There were vultures and eagles, ravens and crows, every sort of bird imaginable, soaring and flapping their wings, yet making no more sound than the silent lightning. The dream had filled him with a sense of urgency and confusion.<br>Awake now, Lucius heard a faint rumble of thunder in the distance.<br>He heard other sounds from elsewhere in the house. The slaves were up and beginning to stir, stoking the kitchen fire and opening shutters.<br>Lucius jumped from his bed. His room, with a small balcony looking west, was on the upper floor of the house. Below him was the slope of the Aventine Hill. The nearer houses, along the crest of the hill, were large and well made, like his family&#x2019;s house. Farther down the hill, humbler houses and tenements and artisans&#x2019; workshops were crowded close together, and farther yet was a flat expanse with large granaries and ware houses close to the Tiber. At the river the city ended. On the far side of the Tiber, woods and meadows were divided into the private estates of the rich, which extended to the far horizon of hills and mountains.<br>How his mother hated this view! Born into a wealthy branch of the Cornelius family, she had grown up in a house on the other, more fashionable side of the Aventine Hill, with a view of the vast Circus Maximus below, the Capitoline Hill crowned by temples off to one side, and, directly opposite, the opulent Palatine Hill, where the emperor lived. &#x201c;Why, from our rooftop, when I was a girl,&#x201d; she would say, &#x201c;I could see the smoke from sacrifices on the Capitoline, watch the chariot races below, and even catch a glimpse of the emperor himself, strolling on one of his terraces across the way.&#x201d; (&#x201c;All at the same time, Camilla?&#x201d; Lucius&#x2019;s father would say, gently mocking her.) But this was the view Lucius had grown up with. For twenty-four years this had been the Roma seen from his room, a jumble of the rich and poor&#x2014;mostly the poor&#x2014;where slaves labored endlessly in vast store houses to accommodate all the goods and grain that arrived day after day, carried up the river from the great world beyond, the world that belonged to Roma.<br>The month of Maius had been overcast and rainy so far, and this day promised to be no different. By the dim light of dawn beneath an overcast sky, Lucius saw the towering cypress trees along the Tiber sway this way and that. The blustering winds were warm and carried the smell of rain. In the far distance, black storm clouds roiled on the horizon, bristling with lighting.<br>&#x201c;Perfect weather for an augury!&#x201d; whispered Lucius.<br>His room was sparsely furnished with a narrow bed and a single backless chair, a small pigeonhole bookcase filled with scrolls left over from his childhood education, a mirror on a stand made of burnished copper, and a few trunks to accommodate his clothing. He opened the most ornate of the trunks and carefully removed the special garment it contained.<br>Ordinarily, he would have waited for a slave to help him dress&#x2014;arranging the folds correctly was a complicated task&#x2014;but Lucius could not wait. The garment was not simply a toga, such as the one he had put on when he became a man at the age of seventeen. It was a trabea, the special garment worn only by augurs, the members of the ancient priesthood trained to divine the will of the gods. It was not white but saffron with broad purple stripes. Except for the fitting, when the tailor had made it for him, this was the first time Lucius had even touched the trabea. The never-worn wool was soft and thick and had a fresh smell of murex dye.<br>He put on the garment and did his best to pull the hanging folds into a proper arrangement. He glanced at himself in the copper mirror, then reached into the trunk again. He picked up a slender ivory wand that ended in a little spiral. The lituus was a family heirloom and a familiar friend; Lucius had spent countless hours practicing with it in preparation for this day. But now he looked at the lituus with fresh eyes, studying the intricate carvings that decorated every part of its surface with images of ravens, crows, owls, eagles, vultures, and chickens, as well as foxes, wolves, horses, and dogs&#x2014;all the various creatures from whose actions a trained augur could interpret the will of the gods.<br>He left his room and descended the stairs, crossed the garden surrounded by a peristyle at the center of the house, and stepped into the dining room, where his mother and father reclinined together on a couch while a slave served their breakfast.<br>His mother was wearing a simple stola, with her long hair not yet combed and pinned for the day. She leaped up from her couch. &#x201c;Lucius! What are you doing dressed in your trabea already? You can&#x2019;t eat breakfast wearing that! What if you get food on it? The ceremony is hours away. We&#x2019;ll be going to the baths first. The barber must shave you and your father&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>Lucius laughed. &#x201c;Mother, I did it on a whim. Of course I won&#x2019;t wear it to breakfast. But what do you think?&#x201d;<br>Camilla sighed. &#x201c;You look splendid, Lucius. Absolutely splendid! As handsome as ever your father was in his trabea. Don&#x2019;t you think so, dear?&#x201d;<br>Lucius&#x2019;s father, who strove always to maintain the restraint proper to a man of his standing&#x2014;a patrician, a senator, and a cousin of the emperor&#x2014;merely nodded. &#x201c;Handsome our boy certainly is. But looking pretty is not the point when a man puts on his trabea. A priest must carry his garment as he carries his lituus, with dignity and authority, as befits the intermediary of the gods.&#x201d;<br>Lucius drew back his shoulders, raised his chin, and held forth his lituus. &#x201c;What do you think, father? Do I look properly dignified?&#x201d;<br>The elder Lucius Pinarius looked at his son and raised an eyebrow. To him, young Lucius often still looked like a boy, and never more so than at this moment, dressed up in priestly finery but with the folds of his trabea tucked and draped haphazardly, like a child in grown-up costume. Twenty-four was very young for a man to be inducted into the college of augurs. The elder Pinarius had been in his forties before the honor came to him. With his black hair mussed from sleeping, his broad smile, and his smoothly handsome features, young Lucius hardly fit the standard image of the wrinkled, gray-haired augur. Still, the young man came from a long line of augurs, and he had shown great aptitude in his studies.<br>&#x201c;You look very fine, my son. Now, go change into a nice tunic. We shall have a bite to eat, then be off to the baths for a wash and a shave, then hurry back home to get ready for the ceremony. Hopefully, the storm will hold off and we won&#x2019;t be drenched with rain.&#x201d;<br>Having a slave arrange the trabea certainly made a difference, Lucius had to admit, as he studied himself in the copper mirror later that day. The sight of himself freshly groomed and properly outfitted in his trabea filled him with confidence. Of course, he was not an augur quite yet. Preceding the induction ceremony there would be a final examination in which Lucius would be called upon to demonstrate his skills. Lucius frowned. He was a little nervous about the examination.<br>This time, when he descended from his room, his mother almost swooned at the sight of him. His father, now dressed in his own trabea and carrying his own lituus, gave him a warm smile of approval.<br>&#x201c;Shall we be off, father?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not quite yet. You have a visitor.&#x201d;<br>Across the garden, a young man and a girl were seated on a bench beneath the peristyle.<br>&#x201c;Acilia!&#x201d; Lucius began to run to her, then slowed his pace. A trabea was not made for running, and it would not do to catch the soft wool on a thorn as he passed the rose bushes.<br>Acilia&#x2019;s older brother rose to his feet, nodded curtly, and discreetly withdrew. Looking over his shoulder, Lucius saw that his parents had also disappeared, to allow him a moment of privacy with his betrothed.<br>Lucius took her hands in his. &#x201c;Acilia, you look beautiful today.&#x201d; It was true. Her honey-colored hair was worn long and straight, as befitted an unmarried girl. Her eyes were bright blue. Her cheeks were as smooth as rose petals. Her petite body was largely hidden by her modest, long-sleeved tunica, but during the year that they had been betrothed she had definitely begun to acquire the contours of a woman&#x2019;s body. She was ten years younger than Lucius.<br>&#x201c;Look at you, Lucius&#x2014;so handsome in your trabea!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what my mother said.&#x201d; As they strolled across the garden, he suddenly felt self-conscious about their surroundings. Lucius was acutely aware that the house of Acilia&#x2019;s father was far grander than that of the Pinarii, more lavishly furnished, tended by more house hold slaves, and located on the more fashionable side of the Aventine Hill, near the Temple of Diana. The Acilii were plebeians, descended from a family far less ancient than the patrician Pinarii, but the Acilii had a great deal of money, while the fortunes of the Pinarii had dwindled in recent years. Lucius&#x2019;s late grandfather had owned a fine mansion on the Palatine, but his debts had forced the family to move to their current accommodations. To be sure, the vestibule of their house contained the wax masks of many venerable ancestors, but that was not the sort of thing to impress a girl. Had Acilia noticed how overgrown and untended the garden was? Lucius remembered the perfectly trimmed hedges and topiaries, the marble walkways and expensive pieces of bronze statuary in the garden at Acilia&#x2019;s house. The roof of the peristyle behind Acilia was missing more than a few tiles, and the wall was unsightly with peeling plaster and water stains. The slave who was supposed to tend the garden was already overworked with other duties, and there was no money to repair the roof or the wall.<br>Lack of money: that was the reason they were not yet married. Acilia&#x2019;s father, after the initial excitement of betrothing his daughter to the patrician son of a senator and a cousin of the emperor, had since found one excuse after another to postpone setting a date for the ceremony. Obviously, having discovered more about the Pinarii&#x2019;s finances, Titus Acilius had grown dubious about Lucius&#x2019;s prospects in the world. From the moment Lucius first saw her, at a meeting arranged by their fathers, Lucius had liked Acilia; since then he had fallen hopelessly in love with her, and she seemed to feel the same. But that counted for nothing unless her father could be swayed to approve the union.<br>Acilia said nothing about the state of the garden or the unsightly wall. She gazed admiringly at the lituus he carried.<br>&#x201c;Such ornate carvings! What is it made of?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ivory.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;From the tusk of an elephant?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So they say.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s been in the family a long time. You can tell the ivory is very old, because of the color. Many generations of Pinarii have been augurs, taking auspices at state ceremonies, on battlefields, at temple dedications. And at private events, as well, like ... weddings.&#x201d;<br>Acilia seemed duly impressed. &#x201c;And only men from the ancient patrician families can become augurs?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; And I can give you a patrician son, he thought. Yet even as he basked in her admiration, he heard a scurrying noise and looked up to see a rat running along the roof of the peristyle behind her. With a flick of its long tail, the rat dislodged a loose tile. Hearing Lucius gasp, Acilia look around just in time to see the tile fall and shatter on a paving stone. She jumped and uttered a little cry. Had she seen the rat?<br>To distract her, he seized her shoulder, spun her around to face him, and kissed her. It was only a quick kiss, but still she looked astonished.<br>&#x201c;Lucius, what if my brother should see?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;See what? This?&#x201d;<br>He kissed her again, not as quickly.<br>She drew back, blushing but looking pleased. Directly in front of her was the amulet on the necklace that Lucius was wearing. It had slipped from inside his trabea and lay nestled amid the saffron-and-purple folds.<br>&#x201c;Is that part of your augur&#x2019;s outfit?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s a family heirloom. My grandfather gave it to me when I ten years old. I wear it only on special occasions.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;May I touch it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br>She reached up to touch the little lump of gold, which was vaguely cruciform in shape.<br>&#x201c;I remember the day my grandfather gave it to me. He showed me the proper way to wear a toga, and then took me all around the city, just the two of us. He showed me the exact spot where his great-uncle, Julius Caesar, was murdered. He showed me the Great Altar of Hercules, the most ancient shrine in the city, which was erected by the Pinarius family in the days before Roma even existed. He showed me the fig tree on the Palatine where Romulus and Remus and their friend Pinarius climbed among the branches. And finally he showed me the Temple of Venus that Caesar built, and that was the first time I saw the fantastic golden statue of Cleopatra inside. My grandfather knew Cleopatra very well, and he knew Marcus Antonius, too. Someday ... someday I want to have a son, and take him to see all those things, and tell him about his ancestors.&#x201d;<br>Acilia still held the amulet. As he spoke, she had drawn closer to him, until her body pressed gently against his. She gazed at the amulet, then looked up into his eyes.<br>&#x201c;But what sort of amulet is this? I can&#x2019;t make out the shape.&#x201d;<br>Lucius shook his head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny, my grandfather made such a fuss about giving it to me, but even he wasn&#x2019;t sure what it&#x2019;s supposed to represent or where it came from. He only knew that it had been in the family for many generations. The original shape must have worn away over so many lifetimes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing like that in our family,&#x201d; said Acilia, clearly impressed. She was so close that Lucius felt an urge to put his arms around her and hold her tightly against him, no matter that her brother might appear at any moment. But the sky above them suddenly opened and pelted the garden with rain. The raindrops were warm, and Lucius would have been happy to stand there, holding her, both of them getting soaking wet, but Acilia dropped the amulet, seized his hand, and with a shriek of laughter pulled him through the peristyle and into the house.<br>They found Lucius&#x2019;s father and Acilia&#x2019;s brother sitting next to each other in a pair of matching ebony chairs with inlays of lapis and abalone. It was no accident that his father had guided their guest to the best two pieces of furniture in the house.<br>Marcus Acilius was only a few years older than his sister and had the same golden hair and bright blue eyes. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s been five years since the disaster that took place in the Teutoberg Forest,&#x201d; he was saying, &#x201c;and still nothing has been done to settle the score with the Germanic tribes. They&#x2019;re laughing at us. It&#x2019;s a scandal!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So, the rain has driven you inside.&#x201d; Lucius&#x2019;s father looked up at the couple and smiled warmly at Acilia. He wanted the marriage to take place as badly as Lucius did. &#x201c;Marcus and I have been talking about the situation in the north.&#x201d; He turned his attention back to Acilia&#x2019;s brother.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a young man, Marcus. Five years seems to you a very long time. But in the grand scheme of things, it&#x2019;s no more than the blink of an eye. This city was not built in a day, nor was the empire conquered in a lifetime. To be sure, for a long time, Roma seemed unstoppable. Ever outward our legions pushed the limits of the empire, and all obstacles fell befor...</p><h2>Imperial Identities: Stereotyping, Prejudice, and Race in Colonial Algeria, New Edition</h2><p><p><i>Imperial Identities</i> is a groundbreaking book that addresses identity formation in colonial Algeria of two predominant ethnicities and analyzes French attitudes in the context of nineteenth-century ideologies.

Lieutenant Lord Hector Pierpont fired his second shot, but rage apparently made the man careless. A venerable oak lost a few bare twigs to the field of honor.</p> <p>"I shall die, bien s�r," Sebastian said, a prayer as much as a promise. "But not today."</p> <p>He took aim on Pierpont's lapel. An English officer to his very bones, Pierpont stood still, eyes closed, waiting for death to claim him. In the frosty air, his breath clouded before him in the same shallow pants that might have characterized postcoital exertion.</p> <p>Such drama. Sebastian cocked his elbow and dealt another wound to the innocent oak branches. "And neither shall you die today. It was war, Pierpont. For the sake of your womenfolk, let it be over."</p> <p>Sebastian fired the second bullet overhead to punctuate that sentiment, also to ensure no loaded weapons remained within Pierpont's ambit. When Pierpont opened his eyes, Sebastian gazed into loathing so intense as to confirm his lordship would rather be dead than suffer any more of Sebastian's clemency or sermonizing.</p> <p>Sebastian walked up to him and spoke quietly enough that the seconds could not hear.</p> <p>"You gave away nothing. What little scraps you threw me had long since reached the ears of French intelligence. Go home, kiss your wife, and give her more babies, but leave me and mine in peace. Next time, I will not delope, mon ami."</p> <p>He slapped Pierpont lightly on the cheek, a small, friendly reminder of other blows, and walked away.</p> <p>"You are not fit to breathe the air of England, St. Clair."</p> <p>This merited a dismissive parting wave of Sebastian's hand. Curses were mere bagatelles to a man who'd dealt in screams and nightmares for years. "Au revoir, Pierpont. My regards to your wife and daughters."</p> <p>The former captain and his missus were up to two. Charming little demoiselles with Pierpont's dark eyes. Perhaps from their mother they might inherit some common sense and humor.</p> <p>"Cold bastard."</p> <p>That, from Captain Anderson, one of Pierpont's seconds. Anderson was a twitchy, well-fed blond fellow with a luxurious mustache. Threaten the mustache, and Monsieur Bold Condescension would chirp out the location of his mother's valuables like a nightingale in spring.</p> <p>Michael Brodie snatched the pistol from Sebastian's grasp, took Sebastian by the arm, and led him toward their horses. "You've had your fun, now come along like a good baron."</p> <p>"Insubordinate, you are. I thought the English were bad, but you Irish give the term realms of meaning Dr. Johnson never dreamed."</p> <p>"You are English, lest we forget the reason yon righteous arse wants to perforate your heart at thirty paces. Get on the horse, Baron, and I'm only half-Irish."</p> <p>A fact dear Michel had kept quiet until recently.</p> <p>Sebastian pretended to test the tightness of Fable's girth, but used the moment to study Pierpont, who was in conversation with his seconds. Pierpont was in good enough weight, and he was angry-furious-but not insane with it. Nothing about his complexion or his eyes suggested habitual drunkenness, and he had two small, adorable daughters who needed their papa's love and adoration.</p> <p>Maybe today's little exchange would allow them to have it.</p> <p>"You fret, Michel, and one wants to strike you for it. The English are violent with their servants, non? Perhaps today I will be English after all."</p> <p>"The French were violent with the entire Continent, best as I recall, and bits of Africa and the high seas into the bargain. You ought not to begrudge the English some violence with their help from time to time. Keeps us on our toes."</p> <p>Michael climbed aboard his bay, and Sebastian swung up on Fable.</p> <p>Burnished red eyebrows lowered into a predictable scowl. "You would have to ride a white horse," Michael groused. "Might as well paint a target on your back and send a boy ahead to warn all and sundry the Traitor Baron approaches."</p> <p>Sebastian nudged his horse forward.</p> <p>"Fable was black as the infernal pit when he was born. I cannot help what my horse decides to do with his hair. That is between him and his God. Stop looking over your shoulder, Michel. Pierpont was an officer. He will not shoot me in the back, and he will not blame you for sparing all others the burden of seconding me."</p> <p>Michael took one more look over his shoulder-both the Irish half of him and the Scottish half were well endowed with contrariness.</p> <p>"How many duels does that make, your lordship? Four? Five? One of these honorable former officers will put paid to your existence, and where will Lady Freddy be, then? Think on that the next time you're costing me and Fable our beauty sleep."</p> <p>He took out a flask and imbibed a hefty swallow, suggesting his nerves were truly in bad repair.</p> <p>"I am sorry." Such flaccid words Sebastian offered, but sincere. "You should not worry about my early outings. These men do not want to kill me any more than I wanted to kill them."</p> <p>Michael knew better than to offer his flask. "You didn't kill them, that's the problem. What you did was worse, and even if they don't want to kill you-which questionable conclusion we can attribute to your woefully generous complement of Gallic arrogance-the rest of England, along with a few loyal Scots, some bored Welshmen, and six days a week, an occasional sober Irishman, would rather you died. I'm in the employ of a dead man."</p> <p>"Melodrama does not become you." Sebastian cued Fable into a canter, lest Michael point out that melodrama, becoming or not, had long enjoyed respect as a socially acceptable means of exposing painful and inconvenient truths.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In Millicent Danforth's experience, the elderly, like most stripes of human being, came in two varieties: fearful and brave. Her grandmother had been fearful, asking incessantly for tisanes or tea, for cosseting and humoring. Like a small child, Grandmother had wanted distracting from the inevitability of her own demise.</p> <p>By contrast, Lady Frederica, Baroness St. Clair, viewed her eventual death as a diversion. She would threaten the help with it, lament it gently with her many friends, and use it as an excuse for very blunt speech indeed.</p> <p>"You are to be a companion, not a nursemaid. You will not vex me with your presence when I attend my correspondence after breakfast. You will appear at my side when I take the landau out for a turn in the park. Shall you write this down?"</p> <p>Milly returned her prospective employer's beady-eyed glower calmly.</p> <p>"I will not bother you after breakfast unless you ask it of me. I will join you when you take the air in the park. I believe I can recall that much, my lady. What will my other duties involve?"</p> <p>She asked because Mr. Loomis at the agency had been spotty on the details, except for the need to show up at an unseemly early hour for this interview.</p> <p>"A companion-you keep Lady St. Clair company!" he'd barked. "Step, fetch, soothe, entertain. Now, be off with you!"</p> <p>The way he'd smoothed his wisp of suspiciously dark hair over his pate suggested more would be involved, a great deal more. Perhaps her ladyship tippled, gambled, or neglected to pay the trades-all to be managed by a companion whom the baroness might also forget to regularly compensate.</p> <p>"You will dine with me in the evening and assist me to endure the company of my rascal of a nephew if he deigns to join us. What, I ask you, is so enticing about a rare beefsteak and an undercooked potato with a side of gossip? I can provide that here, as well as a superior cellar, but no, the boy must away to his flower-lovers' club. Never mind, though. He's well-mannered enough that he won't terrorize you-or no more than I will. Are you sure you don't need to write any of this down?"</p> <p>Yes, Milly was quite sure. "I gather you are a list maker, my lady?"</p> <p>Blue eyes lit up as her ladyship reached for the teapot.</p> <p>"Yes! I am never so happy as when I'm organizing. I should have been a general, the late baron used to say. Do you enjoy the opera? One hopes you do, because nothing is more unendurable than the opera if one hasn't a taste for it."</p> <p>Her ladyship chattered on about London openings she'd attended, who had conducted them, and what she had thought of the score, the sets, the crowd in attendance, and the various solos, duets, and ensemble numbers. Her diatribe was like a conversational stiff wind, banging the windows open all at once, setting curtains flapping, papers flying, and lapdogs barking.</p> <p>"You're not drinking your tea, Miss Danforth."</p> <p>"I am attending your ladyship's recitation of my duties."</p> <p>The baroness clinked her teacup down on its saucer. "You were estimating the value of this tea service. Jasperware is more practical, but it's so heavy. I prefer the S�vres, and Sebastian likes it too."</p> <p>Sebastian might well be a follower. Milly had stolen a moment while waiting for this audience to glance over the cards sitting in a crystal bowl on the sideboard in the front hall. Her ladyship's social life was quite lively, and by no means were her callers all female.</p> <p>"The service is pretty," Milly observed, though it was more than pretty, and perfectly suited to the pastel and sunshine of her ladyship's breakfast parlor. They were using the older style of S�vres, more easily broken, but also impressively hued. Her ladyship's service boasted brilliant pink roses, soft green foliage, and gold trim over a white glaze. "Meissen or Dresden aren't as decorative, though they are sturdier."</p> <p>The baroness used silver tongs to put a flaky golden croissant on a plate. "So you are a lady fallen on hard times?"</p> <p>She was a lady who'd blundered. Paid companions did not need to know that fifteen years ago, S�vres was made without kaolin, fired at a lower temperature, and capable of taking a wider and more bold palette of hues as a result.</p> <p>"My mother was a lady fallen on hard times. I am a poor relation who would make her own way rather than burden my cousins any further."</p> <p>"Kicked you out, did they?" Her ladyship's tone suggested she did not approve of such cousins. "Or perhaps they realized that underneath all that red hair, you're quite pretty, though brown eyes are not quite the rage. One hopes you aren't delicate?"</p> <p>She passed Milly the pastry and shifted the butter a few inches closer to Milly's side of the table.</p> <p>"I enjoy excellent health, thank you, your ladyship." Excellent physical health, anyway. "And I prefer to call my hair auburn."</p> <p>The baroness snorted at that gambit, then poured herself more tea. "Will these cousins come around to plague you?"</p> <p>They would have to bother to find her first. "I doubt it."</p> <p>"You wouldn't be married to one of them, would you?"</p> <p>Milly nearly choked on soft, buttery pastry. "I am not married." For which she might someday be grateful.</p> <p>"Then I will regularly scandalize your innocent ears and enjoy doing it. Eat up. When Sebastian gets back from his morning ride, he'll go through that sideboard like a plague of locusts. If you prefer coffee, you'd best get your servings before he comes down in the morning. The man cannot abide tea in any form."</p> <p>"The plague of locusts has arrived."</p> <p>Milly's head snapped around at the mocking baritone. She beheld...her opposite. Whereas she was female, short-petite, when the occasion was polite-red-haired, and brown-eyed, the plague before her was male, tall, green-eyed, and sable-haired. The divergence didn't stop there.</p> <p>This fellow sauntered into the parlor, displaying a casual elegance about his riding attire that suggested time on the Continent. His tailoring was exquisite, but his movement was also so relaxed as to approach languid. The lace at his throat came within a whisker of being excessive, and the emerald winking from its snowy depths stayed barely on the acceptable side of ostentatious, for men seldom wore jewels during daylight hours, and certainly not for so mundane an undertaking as a hack in the park.</p> <p>This biblical plague had...sartorial �clat.</p> <p>Again, the opposite of Milly, who generally bustled through life, wore the plainest gowns she could get away with, and had never set foot outside London and the Home Counties.</p> <p>"Aunt, you will observe the courtesies, please?"</p> <p>This was the rascal of a nephew then, though as Milly endured his scrutiny, the term rascal struck her as incongruously affectionate for the specimen before her.</p> <p>"Miss Millicent Danforth, may I make known to you my scamp of a nephew, Sebastian, Baron St. Clair. St. Clair, Miss Danforth-my new companion. You are not to terrorize her before she and I have negotiated terms."</p> <p>"Of course not. I terrorize your staff only after you've obligated them to a contract."</p> <p>If this was teasing, Milly did not regard it as humorous. Her ladyship, however, graced her nephew with a smile.</p> <p>"Rotten boy. You may take your plate to the library and read your newspapers in peace."</p> <p>His lordship, who was not a boy in any sense, bowed to Milly with a Continental flourish, bowed again over Lady St. Clair's hand, tucked some newspapers under his arm, and strolled from the room.</p> <p>"He's been dueling again." The baroness might have reported that her nephew had been dicing in the mews, her tone truculent rather than aghast. "They leave the poor boy no peace, those gallant buffoons old Arthur is so proud of."</p> <p>For all his smoothness, something about St. Clair had not sat exactly plumb, but then, what did it say about a man if he could face death at sunrise and appear completely unaffected by the time he downed his morning coffee?</p> <p>"How can you tell he was dueling?" For ladies weren't supposed to know of such things, much less small elderly ladies who lived for their correspondence and tattle.</p> <p>"He's sad. Dueling always makes him sad. Just when I think he's making some progress, another one of these imbeciles finds a bit of courage, and off to some sheep meadow they go. I swear, if women ruled the world, it would be a damned sight better place. Have I shocked you?"</p> <p>"Several times, my lady."</p> <p>"Excellent. Have another pastry."</p> <p>Milly munched away on a confection filled with chocolate cr�me-one could learn to appreciate such fare all too easily-while Lady St. Clair waxed enthusiastic about the affairs of Wellington-for who else could "old Arthur" be?-and his officers.</p> <p>And still, something about the Baron St. Clair lodged in Milly's awareness like a smudge on her spectacles. He was quite handsome-an embarrassment of handsomeness was his to command-but cold. His smile reached his eyes only when he beheld his elderly aunt.</p> <p>Perhaps dueling had taxed his store of charm.</p> <p>"...and the ladies tr�s jolie, you know?" Lady St. Clair was saying. "Half the fellows in government claimed they needed to go to Paris to make peace, but the soiled doves of London went into a decline until the negotiations were complete. Making peace is lusty work, methinks."</p> <p>"I'm shocked yet again, my lady." Though not by the baroness's bawdy talk.&lt;...</p></p><h2>Entry Denied: Controlling Sexuality At The Border</h2><p>Lesbians, prostitutes, women likely to have sex across racial lines, "brought to the United States for immoral purposes, " or "arriving in a state of pregnancy" -- national threats, one and all. Since the late nineteenth century, immigrant women's sexuality has been viewed as a threat to national security, to be contained through strict border-monitoring practices. By scrutinizing this policy, its origins, and its application, Eithne Luibheid shows how the U.S. border became a site not just for controlling female sexuality but also for contesting, constructing, and renegotiating sexual identity.<p>Initially targeting Chinese women, immigration control based on sexuality rapidly expanded to encompass every woman who sought entry to the United States. The particular cases Luibheid examines -- efforts to differentiate Chinese prostitutes from wives, the 1920s exclusion of Japanese wives to reduce the Japanese-American birthrate, the deportation of a Mexican woman on charges of lesbianism, the role of rape in mediating women's border crossings today -- challenge conventional accounts that attribute exclusion solely to prejudice or lack of information. This innovative work clearly links sexuality-based immigration exclusion to a dominant nationalism premised on sexual, gender, racial, and class hierarchies.</p></p><p></p><h2>Incorrect Merciful Impulses</h2><p><p>"A poet to watch."&#x2014;<i>O Magazine</i></p><p>"I tell the truth, but I try to be kind about it."&#x2014;Camille Rankine in <i>12 Questions</i></p><p>Named "a poet to watch" by <i>O Magazine</i>, Camille Rankine's debut collection is a series of provocations and explorations.

It established a new science of astrological psychology. It presents a language of energy that has enabled astrology to be widely and reliably used in the helping professions as well as by the general public. As Library Journal stated, &#x201c;Transcending the boundaries of separate disciplines, this work represents a major distillation of astrological principles.<br><br>This book relates astrology to modem psychology and explains the use of astrology as a practical method of understanding one&#x2019;s attunement to universal forces. It clearly shows how to approach astrology with a real understanding of the energies involved. Part I of the book explains how astrology can be the most valuable psychological tool for understanding oneself and others. Analyzing the scientific, philosophical, and intuitive dimensions of astrology, it is oriented toward the layman with no astrological knowledge, astrology students and professionals, and those engaged in any form of the counseling arts.<br><br>Part II deals specifically with the interpretation and practical application of astrological factors based on the actual energies involved (air, fire, water, &amp; earth). It presents a dynamic application of astrological knowledge that clarifies and illuminates traditional techniques and meanings by placing them in the perspective of understanding the vital energies inherent in all life processes.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>About the Author<br><br>STEPHEN ARROYO holds an MA Degree in Psychology and the California State License in Marriage and Family Counseling and for many years maintained a busy counseling practice.

Arroyo has written seven books on psychologically oriented astrology which outline his theory that the individual&#39;s experience of the Solar System&#39;s impacts on their personal energy field, both psychological and physical. His works recast astrological concepts in psychological terms, and reject what he perceives as the fatalism and negativity of old-fashioned astrology. His books have now been translated into 20 languages. Regarding his written works, the Library Journal stated: &#34;The simplicity and clarity of his treatment of complex ideas is remarkable; it makes accessible even to the beginner a wealth of understanding....giving meaningful psychological grounding to astrological interpretation. [citation needed] Arroyo has been guest speaker at events in the North America and Europe, and has taught astrology courses in the United States. He has been awarded the British Astrological Association Astrology Prize, the Fraternity of Canadian Astrologers&#39; International Sun Award, and the United Astrology Congress&#39;s Regulus Award.

Discoveries of gold, silver, telluride, and coal nearby put the little supply town on the map, and early miners, farmers, and businessmen prospered there. The railroad&#x2019;s arrival in 1873 brought more newcomers who cultivated a diverse community full of new businesses, social organizations, and schools, and the town flourished despite the social problems and economic fluctuations that were typical of early mining towns. By the 1890s, education, health, and tourism had become significant to Boulder&#x2019;s economic development, a pattern that continues to this day. Great change came about during the early 1900s in the form of a citywide alcohol prohibition, the influenza epidemic, and the closure of the &#x201c;Switzerland Trail&#x201d; railroad in 1919, but Boulder weathered these difficult times even as it witnessed the end of the great railroading era.</p><p>Historian, writer, and genealogist Mona Lambrecht grew up in Boulder, and the town&#x2019;s early history and people continue to captivate her.

Windows were blown out uptown at the New York Public Library; the main building at Ellis Island was nearly destroyed; Statue of Liberty was torn into by shrapnel from the explosion, which would have measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. Chaos overtook Manhattan as the midnight sky turned to fire, lit up with exploding ammunition. <br><br>The year was 1916. And it had been shockingly easy.<br><br>While war raged in Europe, Americans watched from afar, unthreatened by the danger overseas. Yet the United States was riddled with networks of German spies hiding in plain sight. The attack on New York Harbor was only one part of their plans: secret anthrax facilities were located just ten miles from the White House; bombs were planted on ships, hidden in buildings, and mailed to the country's civic and business leaders; and an underground syndicate helped potential terrorists obtain fake IDs, housing, and money. President Woodrow Wilson knew an attack of this magnitude was possible, and yet nothing was done to stop it. Americans, feeling buffered by miles of ocean and burgeoning prosperity, had ignored the mounting threat. <br><br>That all changed on a warm summer evening in late July, when the island in New York Harbor called Black Tom exploded, setting alight a vast store of munitions destined for the front.<br><br>Three American lawyers--John McCloy, Amos Peaslee, and Harold Martin--made it their mission to solve the Black Tom mystery. Their hunt for justice would take them undercover to Europe, deep into the shadowy world of secret agents and double-crosses, through the halls of Washington and the capitals of Europe. It would challenge their beliefs in right and wrong. And they would discover a sinister plot so vast it could hardly have been imagined--a conspiracy that stretched from downtown Manhattan to the very heart of Berlin.<br><br><i>The Detonators </i>is the first full accounting of a crime and a cover-up that resonate strongly in a post-9/11 America. And much of the atmosphere and rhetoric in play 100 years ago remains eerily similar to discussions surrounding national security and immigration today. As Millman deftly illustrates in <b>THE DETONATORS</b>, an island may have disappeared, but the resulting lessons have only grown stronger and more urgent, and history has a persistent way of stirring up its ghosts. <br><br> This is their story.</p><p><b>Chad Millman </b>is the Editorial Director of ESPN Domestic Digital<i>. </i>He is the author of <i>The Odds </i>and coauthor of <i>The Ones Who Hit the Hardest</i>, <i>Iceman</i>, <i>Invincible</i>, and <i>Pickup Artists</i>. He lives in Connecticut with his wife and two sons.The man-made explosions at Black Tom Island in New York Harbor lasted a few minutes, but the messy international repercussions lasted more than 20 years. Lloyd James reads a true account from WW I, in which German agents destroy an American ammunition dump. Legal battles between the U.S. and Germany inspire a fascinating story of the men involved and the quest for repayment. James has a taciturn voice, and he punctuates the quotes with pleasant pauses. His leisure produces an engaging story for those who enjoy history.

Yet millions of Americans experience their cops as racist, brutal, and trigger-happy: an overly aggressive, militarized enemy of the people. For their part, today's officers feel they are under siege&#x2014;misunderstood, unfairly criticized, and scapegoated for society's ills. Is there a fix? Former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper believes there is.</b><br><br>Policing is in crisis. The last decade has witnessed a vast increase in police aggression, misconduct, and militarization, along with a corresponding reduction in transparency and accountability. It is not just noticeable in African American and other minority communities&#x2014;where there have been a series of high-profile tragedies&#x2014;but in towns and cities across the country. Racism&#x2014;from raw, individualized versions to insidious systemic examples&#x2014;appears to be on the rise in our police departments. Overall, our police officers have grown more and more alienated from the people they've been hired to serve.<br><br>In <i>To Protect and Serve</i>, Stamper delivers a revolutionary new model for American law enforcement: the community-based police department. It calls for fundamental changes in the federal government's role in local policing as well as citizen participation in <i>all</i> aspects of police operations: policymaking, program development, crime fighting and service delivery, entry-level and ongoing education and training, oversight of police conduct, and--especially relevant to today's challenges--joint community-police crisis management. Nothing will ever change until the system itself is radically restructured, and here Stamper shows us how.<br></p><p>Norm Stamper was a cop for 34 years, the first 28 in San Diego, the last 6(1994-2000) as Seattle s police chief.

He is the author of &#34;Breaking Rank: A Top Cop&#39;s Expose of the Dark Side of American Policing&#34; (Nation Books, 2005). He served as a founding member of President Clinton s National Advisory Council on the Violence Against Women Act, and as an advisory board member of Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, along with numerous other boards dedicated to violence prevention, drug policy reform, and social justice.

Magazine.&#34;&#34;This is a book America has been waiting for a top cop's searing expose of corrupt, bigoted, brutal and trigger-happy policing in America and how to fix a broken system. It's the inside story, an MRI from former Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper, showing good cops taking risks to protect us all, to cities balancing the books with police fines, militarization run amok, and a police culture off the rails. Now, says Stamper, the mindset behind the badge has to focus first on public safety, crime, and collaboration not confrontation, with communities asserting control and clear federal standards to insure accountability.

In 1604 the new King James I convened a meeting at Hampton Court to address the problem of the Puritans. The recommendation was for the authorization of a new translation of the Bible, one that would be accessible to the common people and placed in every Church in his realm. Within three years a team of 47 scholars on six committees had begun work in Oxford, Cambridge and Westminster. The fruit of their labours was the Authorized Version published in 1611. Beautifully presented and based on scholarly research, this book traces the fascinating history of the AV from its earliest predecessors through its remarkable influence on the church, literature, and wider society.</p><p>Derek Wilson is a leading historian, broadcaster, speaker and novelist.

For most Africans, incomes are lower than they were two decades ago, health prospects are poorer, malnourishment is widespread, and infrastructures and social institutions are breaking down.</p><br><p>An array of factors have been offered to explain the apparent failure of development in Africa, including the colonial legacy, social pluralism, corruption, poor planning and incompetent management, limited in-flow of foreign capital, and low levels of saving and investment. Alone or in combination, these factors are serious impediments to development, but Claude Ake contends that the problem is not that development has failed, but that it was never really on the agenda. He maintains that political conditions in Africa are the greatest impediment to development.</p><br><p>In this book, Ake traces the evolution and failure of development policies, including the IMF stabilization programs that have dominated international efforts. He identifies the root causes of the problem in the authoritarian political structure of the African states derived from the previous colonial entities. Ake sketches the alternatives that are struggling to emerge from calamitous failure--economic development based on traditional agriculture, political development based on the decentralization of power, and reliance on indigenous communities that have been providing some measure of refuge from the coercive power of the central state. Ake's argument may become a new paradigm for development in Africa.</p><br></p><p>Despite three decades of preoccupations with development in Africa, the economies of most African nations are still-stagnating or regressing.<br><p><br><b>Claude Ake</b> is director of the Centre for Advanced Social Science in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.</p><br></p><h2>Je T&#39;aime: The legendary love story of Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg</h2><p><p>Published on the 50-year anniversary of the legendary song <i>Je t&#x2019;aime... moi non plus,</i>, deemed too risque for many American radio stations, V�ronique Mortaigne&#x2019;s book on Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin is a lyrical retelling of a relationship that defined an age.</p> <i>Synonymous with love, eroticism, glamour, music, provocation, their affair would set France aflame as the sixties ebbed, and set in motion many of the ideas we have by now come to think of as specifically &#x2018;French&#x2019;.<p></p> <p>Skipping back and forth in time, <i>Je t'aime</i> takes the reader from the foggy Normandy landscapes where Serge and Jane retreated, to their carefree summers on the coast.

Johnsgard remarks, is like driving backward in time. &#x201c;I suspect,&#x201d; he says, &#x201c;that the migrating cranes of a pre&#x2013;ice age period some ten million years ago would fully understand every nuance of the crane conversation going on today along the Platte.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;Johnsgard has spent nearly a half century observing cranes, from a yearly foray to Nebraska&#x2019;s Platte River valley to see the spring migration, to pilgrimages to the birds&#x2019; wintering grounds in Arizona and nesting territory in Alaska. In this book he draws from his own extensive experience as well as the latest science to offer a richly detailed and deeply felt account of the ecology of sandhill and whooping cranes and the wetlands in which they live.<br>Incorporating current information on changing migration patterns, population trends, and breeding ranges, Johnsgard explains the life cycle of the crane, as well as the significance of these species to our natural world. He also writes frankly of the uncertain future of these majestic birds, as cranes and their habitats face the effects of climate change and increasing human population pressures. Illustrated with the author&#x2019;s own ink drawings and containing a detailed guide to crane-viewing sites in the United States and Canada, this book is at once an invaluable reference and an eloquent testimony to how much these birds truly mean.<br></p><p>Paul A.

He is the author of more than fifty books on natural history, including <i>Crane Music: A Natural History of American Cranes</i> and <i>Those of the Gray Wind: The Sandhill Cranes</i>, both available in Bison Books editions.&#x201c;In keeping with his long and fascinating series of books about birds, Paul Johnsgard captures the drama of the greatest gathering of cranes on earth&#x2014;the flocking in early spring of more than a half million sandhill cranes along the Platte River, Nebraska. This charming volume transmits that special magic when the cranes, springtime, and the river all meet on the Great Plains in the heart of North America.&#x201d;&#x2014;George Archibald, cofounder of the International Crane Foundation (George Archibald 2010-10-01)<br><br>"No one is better qualified than Johnsgard to discuss cranes both as objects of scientific study and as ancient, magical creatures.

An anthropomorphic little tree is worried that the forest around her is no longer flourishing and wants a better life for her little seed. "Are trees this small everywhere?" she asks a brown bird and learns that there is a place "where trees grow a hundred feet tall" and "leaves are so thick, you can sit in the shade all day!" The little tree decides to toss her seed into the wind. Over the years, the little tree wonders what has become of her bab y seed. "Is it strong and tall? Does it remember me at all?" When the brown bird returns, it tells her about a very special tree; perhaps that is her little seed? The little tree receives her answer when an elegant leaf twirls and shimmers right into her armlike branches. Adinolfi expertly layers mixed media comprising colored pencils, gouache, stamping, and more to create texture and movement on the static page. Add vibrant colors in saturated hues, and the story's dreamlike environs come to life. Full of gentle rhythm and repetition, this deceptively simple, layered poetic tale will charm its way into readers' hearts and begs to be read over and over again."<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews,</i> starred review <i></i>&nbsp; "Muon Van&#x2019;s Author&#x2019;s Note&#x201d; at book&#x2019;s end is a complementary story unto itself. As she poignantly explains why she&#x2019;s written The Little Tree for her mother, Van details her family&#x2019;s departure from war-torn Vietnam, and their eventual root-taking on the other side of the world. Van writes about how her mother is both the little tree and the little seed,&#x201d; of how she went far from her depleted, vanishing homeland for a new life in the United States; there she planted a family of her own, only to release her grown children out into the vast world. Artist JoAnn Adinolfi infuses Van&#x2019;s familial fairy tale with vibrant colors, swirling motion, and whimsical details throughout, as if a reminder of the beauty all around us, even in difficult situations.<br>Written with empathy, drawn with vivacity, The Little Tree turns out to be quite a big story filled with hope, care, trust, and so much love."<br> Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center<br><br>"A small tree, dwarfed by taller trees in a dwindling forest, makes the difficult decision to send her seed away, so that it may flourish where she cannot. This tough, affecting premise becomes even more so when Van (In a Village by the Sea), in an author&#x2019;s note, ties the story to her own family&#x2019;s exodus from Vietnam and to the broader difficulties facing immigrant or refugee families. Van and Adinolfi (The Perfect Christmas) work in synch to preserve the story&#x2019;s emotional power without allowing it to become overly grim. Van writes in the pared-down, repeating language of a fable ( The sun rose and the sun set. The little tree lost count of the seasons&#x201d;), while Adinolfi&#x2019;s mixed-media illustrations, rendered in a bright and cheery palette, picture the little tree and her seed with large, googly eyes in a landscape of rolling hills dotted with houses. The idea that letting someone go can sometimes be the best way to love them isn&#x2019;t an easy one to share with children (or parents, for that matter), but Van and Adinolfi do so with grace and aplomb.

In pages filled with bright painted images of the little tree in her larger forest filled with flying birds, the story of "The Little Tree" unfolds in something akin to narrative free verse. The little tree lives in a shrinking group of mighty old trees surrounded by encroaching human development, and she hopes for a better growing environment for her little seed. She is inspired by the wisdom of a little brown bird who flies to her and tells her of wonderful places where all kinds of trees grow to be a hundred feet tall, with thick leaves and shade everywhere. Though she loves her little seed and will miss her, she asks the brown bird to promise to do her a favor and flap his wings with all his might. Finally the little tree let go of her little seed, watching it fly away with the little brown bird. Much later, after many days and seasons, the little tree asked the brown bird about her little seed. "Where is my little seed? Is it strong and tall? Does it remember me at all?" And after much more waiting, the little tree received an answer, in the form of a floating leaf, shimmering with the color of emeralds. In a joyous, celebratory two page scene, the little tree understood the message of the floating leaf. Her little seed was alive and well, grown into a wonderful tree, and it still remembered her. "The Little Tree" was written by a daughter for her Vietnamese mother, part of an immigrant family who became a model for "The Little Tree" in what she courageously did for her children. A poignant author's note explains a part of the many resonances of the inspiring message of "The Little Tree."<br>--MidWest Book Review<br><br>"Narrated by a little tree, who must let go of her little seed, the story parallels the difficult and brave journey immigrants endure. They must leave a homeland to start afresh in a new country with a different language and customs, continuously trying to do what they can for their offspring. The writing is poetic. The illustrations, created with gouache, watercolor, colored pencils and digital media, add an appropriate and pleasing charm."<br>--San Jose Mercury<br><br>"Van ( In a Village by the Sea&#x201d;) tells the sad, lovely tale of a tree who realizes that the forest she lives in is shrinking.

In the author&#x2019;s note, Muon Van states that the book was written for her mother, who's both the little tree and the little seed.&#x201d; Van&#x2019;s mother left Vietnam after the fall of Saigon, leaving behind her father, who garnered enough resources to enable his children&#x2019;s journey but decided to stay in his homeland to take care of the family&#x2019;s ancestral altar. Van&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s role changed from the transplanted little seed to the little tree after she had nine children herself.

Chanler painted what entertained and interested him, while attracting wealthy Gilded Age patrons and earning popular and critical acclaim at numerous exhibitions&#x2014;including the 1905 Salon d&#x2019;Automne, the show featuring paintings by &#x201c;les fauves,&#x201d; with Henri Matisse as their leader; and the legendary &#x201c;International Exhibition of Modern Art&#x201d; in New York City, popularly known as the 1913 Armory Show. But, despite such a prolific career and a fascinating body of work, Chanler quickly became an obscure figure after his death in 1930. <br><br><i>Robert Winthrop Chanler: Discovering the Fantastic </i>is the first comprehensive examination in more than eighty years of an artist who straddled the divide between fine and decorative art, defined notions of originality and authorship during the birth of American modernism, and posthumously challenges twenty-first century preservationists through his idiosyncratic techniques and unorthodox material choices. <br><br>Co-published with Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, which preserves Chanler&#x2019;s fantastic undersea mural on the swimming pool grotto ceiling of the historic estate, the book includes essays that explore major commissions and conservation issues, all illustrated with new color photography, as well as a chronology and exhibition history, making this the definitive study on an indelible American modernist.</p><p><b>Gina Wouters </b>is curator at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens.

He sank down on it and rested his sword across his lap.<br><br>To his right, in the stable area of the house, his destrier snorted and stamped, aroused by the danger. To his left, on a bed near the hearth, the youth William moaned in pain and madness.<br><br>This end would probably be a mercy for William. Better to face a quick death than to endure the agony that burned your brain and deformed your body with black sores.<br><br>Where had they come from, this clutch of peasants who shouted curses and threats? He couldn't hear them distinctly, for the walls of the longhouse were stone and the door and one small window were closed. The only light in the chamber came from the fire he had built in the hearth when he had dragged William in.<br><br>The whole village had appeared deserted when he had led his men here seeking shelter for William. The disease had manifested itself yesterday, just in time for the gate guard at Brest to deny them entry to the port city. And so they had continued north along the coastal road.<br><br>It was only after he sent his men back toward Brest that the villagers had emerged. He had nailed a black cloth on the door in warning, and so they knew that the disease lurked within. These peasants had a right to be angry. The death had already run its course in Brittany and they knew all too well the danger lying in the longhouse.<br><br>He eyed the thatched roof above him. They could not risk entering. It would be fire. They only lacked the leader to emerge who would rouse them to it. And the night. It was always easier to do these things at night.<br><br>He could have left the squire and gone on, of course. It had crossed his mind, unworthy thought that it was. But he had held William on his horse and the disease would claim him too. The men would wait for him at the last crossroad as planned, would wait, he knew, the full day or even more. But if he went to them he would carry the death with him. Better to stay and die here. John would get the men back to Brest and across the sea to England. They didn't like John much, but they would follow him that far.<br><br>The noise outside changed. The cries fell into pauses and shouts. One voice yelled and then the crowd responded. They had found their leader.<br><br>William thrashed on the bed, his breath rasping. He called out several times to Sir Richard, the Gascon lord whom they had served until the plague had claimed Richard and his household and Morvan had taken the responsibility of getting William home.<br><br>The crowd grew more raucous. Their leader called something over and over and they picked up the chant. Morvan only understood a little of the Breton language, but it sounded like &#x201c;No more!&#x201d;<br><br>Maybe they wouldn't wait until night.<br><br>The chant soared, reaching new levels, the emotion of the mob thundering off the door. He gripped the hilt of his sword as the pounding of his blood matched the rhythms of the screaming peasants. Louder and higher and faster the yelling roared until it doubled in on itself and became an unending violent noise.<br><br>Then suddenly it stopped, swallowed in an instant by a hollow silence.<br><br>He waited, tensed for an attack. They hadn't left. He could still hear some movement. Compared with the previous din, however, the quiet possessed a physical presence.<br><br>The door of the longhouse opened a handspan. A slice of brilliant light fell on the floor. He rose and held his sword ready, to protect the villagers as much as himself.<br><br>The door swung wide. Two knights stood at the threshold, in the blinding glare of the afternoon sun. They appeared as silhouettes surrounded by halos, but their bearings and weapons proclaimed their status. Both had swords in hand.<br><br>One looked to be in his late twenties. Golden hair swept back from his forehead to his shoulders. He wore full armor except a helmet and was of medium height and build. His dark, deep-set eyes contrasted strangely with the fair hair.<br><br>The other was harder to see since he stood farther in the doorway. The sun picked up a glow of blond curls tumbling about his head and shoulders. He was taller than the other, but more slight of build. This one wore no armor, but instead a gray cotte and a black cloak. From his clothes and youthful frame he might have been just a squire, but the authority of his stance said otherwise.<br><br>The younger one spoke. &#x201c;Put up your weapon. No harm will come to you here.&#x201d;<br><br>Morvan peered past them through the open door. The villagers were gone. He sheathed his sword. The young knight strode through the shadows toward William's bed. &#x201c;Go no farther,&#x201d; Morvan warned. &#x201c;Your people were right. It is the death.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not fear it.&#x201d; The other man joined him and together they examined William. Then the older knight went back outside.<br><br>&#x201c;Were you alone?&#x201d; The voice was young, yet full of authority and command.<br><br>&#x201c;Nay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are the others?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Waiting. About an hour hence.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The death spreads quickly and they may be carrying it. We must bring them back. I promise you and yours care, but they must return.&#x201d;<br><br>Morvan told him about the crossroad.<br><br>&#x201c;Will they obey you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then give me your cloak, so they know we come from you.&#x201d;<br><br>Morvan unfastened the brooch and handed over his cloak, then followed the young knight to the doorway. Outside, in addition to the older knight, were six mounted men-at-arms and a youth no older than a squire. Two riderless horses waited nearby, one a handsome bay mare that appeared almost motionless.<br><br>The older knight came forward carrying a small box.<br><br>&#x201c;Ascanio, here is his cloak,&#x201d; the young knight said. &#x201c;The others are at the first crossroad toward Brest. We will wait here for the boy to pass, and then meet you at the keep. Tell the servants to have all prepared.&#x201d;<br><br>Ascanio took the cloak and handed it up to the youth. Then he returned to the doorway. &#x201c;I must shrive him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Aye. But say the sacrament quickly.&#x201d;<br><br>So the older knight was a priest. It was not unheard of, but rare.<br><br>Morvan stepped outside into the sunlight. The men-at-arms eased their horses away. The young knight followed and spoke. &#x201c;The squire is far along. I am sorry, but I have seen this many times. He will die soon.&#x201d;<br><br>Morvan turned to respond. What stood there stopped the words in his mouth. In the clear afternoon light he saw that the young knight was not a knight at all, but a woman.<br><br>She presented a startling sight. For one thing, she was very tall. He was a big man, bigger than most, and he judged that she would reach his nose. Her blond hair fell in a tumble of unruly curls around her face and just past her shoulders. The face itself was oval-shaped, with high cheekbones and a straight nose. She was dressed all in men's clothes, the cotte too large and bagging over the belt that held her sword. Soft high boots reached almost to the hem at her hose-covered knees. The loose clothing and black cloak hid the bulge of her breasts, but here in the sun her woman's slender form was unmistakable.<br><br>Large sapphire eyes gazed back at him, compelling his attention. &#x201c;What is your name, sir knight?&#x201d; The voice should have told him. It was deep and throaty, but possessed a velvet softness. She and Ascanio spoke French to him, the language used by the Breton nobility.<br><br>&#x201c;Morvan Fitzwaryn, my lady.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are English, but Morvan is an honored name here in Brittany.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is a family name. My ancestor rode with the Conqueror, but hailed from the Breton marches near Normandy.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled, and he realized that she was probably younger than her manner and authority implied. &#x201c;Well, Morvan Fitzwaryn, you need not stare. Surely you know that our civil war has made some Breton women very strange.&#x201d;<br><br>She was referring to Jeanne de Montfort, the last duke's wife. While her husband was imprisoned by the King of France, she had taken his place at the head of his army. Morvan had met her once in England before her husband had died and she had passed from strange to mad, leaving her son, the young duke, in King Edward's care.<br><br>The young woman before him held herself as proud and tall as any man. &#x201c;I am Anna de Leon. You are on my family's lands. Since you are English, you may be glad to know that we are Montfortists and not supporters of Charles de Blois and the Penthiovre claims to the ducal crown.&#x201d;<br><br>He hadn't even thought about it, and did not care overmuch. Considering the likelihood of his imminent death, the war of succession in Brittany seemed insignificant.<br><br>The priest-knight Ascanio emerged from the longhouse. &#x201c;It will not be long.&#x201d; He looked skeptically at Morvan, and then at Lady Anna. &#x201c;You will be well here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sir Morvan has nothing to gain from harming me, and his immortal soul to lose. Go now, and find the others.&#x201d; She turned to the youth. &#x201c;Josce, they are our guests, not our prisoners. Follow Ascanio on this.&#x201d;<br><br>They rode off, leaving the bay mare, who had not moved a hair the whole time. &#x201c;Your horse has no saddle,&#x201d; Morvan observed.<br><br>&#x201c;She will take one, but prefers not to. I did not expect a battle today.&#x201d; She walked back into the longhouse.<br><br>She hadn't meant it as a jest. Clearly some days she did expect to be in battle.<br><br>When he followed he found her at the boy's bed, laying a wet cloth on his brow. William accepted her ministrations. His delirious moaning ceased and his fitful movements calmed.<br><br>Morvan gazed at the young, anguished body. Was this what awaited him? He would choose ten deaths in battle compared with this pitiful, ignoble exit. He suddenly wished that this woman had not spared him from the villagers' fire.<br><br>He watched slender, feminine hands do their work. &#x201c;You said that you do not fear the death. If so, you are the only one who does not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not fear it because I have already suffered it. It does not claim the same body twice.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were ill but survived?&#x201d; Over the course of the summer, as this plague ravaged all of Christendom, he had heard tales of whole villages killed, of cities losing half their people. He had never heard of survivors. &#x201c;Are there others?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A few in our villages and the town. Very few.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The priest? Ascanio?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nay. He tempted fate repeatedly, but it never claimed him. There are a few others like that too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why ... How did you live?&#x201d;<br><br>She looked at him with that level gaze. No feminine artifice. No coy glances or veiled expression. She looked at one as a man did. Straight, frank, and honest.<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know how. As to why ... sometimes I felt that I was spared so that there would be someone to bury my people.&#x201d;<br><br>She had been gently stroking William's hair and face. A peaceful sleep had claimed the youth.<br><br>&#x201c;He can go at any moment, or it could take hours. We could hold a death vigil all night. I would get some rest, Sir Morvan. If the madness comes again, I may need your help.&#x201d;<br><br>Morvan glanced at William's face, angelic in its newly found repose. He looked at the half-hidden face of the strange woman whose touch had brought this peace. Then he retreated to the bench across from the door.<br><br>Anna sank down on the floor and leaned her back against the bed. She had learned during those horrible months of fighting the plague to take her sleep when she could get it. She closed her eyes and calculated the calendar of her guests' confinement. If no one besides Sir Morvan got sick, it would be simple. But if it spread through his company they could be in very cold weather before it ran its course. She hoped that none of the villeins or tenants had come in contact with these men.<br><br>The boy's uneven breathing broke her thoughts. She was impressed that this knight had stayed with him. While nursing the plague-stricken she had seen mothers abandon their children, husbands their wives. This curse from God had shown the human soul for the frightened, pitiful thing that it was. She had thought that they were finally done with it, and could go back to rebuilding their illusions. She frankly wished that this knight had performed his noble Christian duty on someone else's lands.<br><br>She turned on her hip and looked down the room. Sir Morvan sat across from the door, his eyes closed and his body slouched against the wall. The door stood ajar and the light barely reached him, but it was enough for her to study his face.<br><br>It was a handsome face, and had probably been beautiful when he was a boy, before battle and time had hardened it. Now weather-bronzed skin stretched from strong cheekbones to square jaw, creating shadowed hollows between. He had a fine nose and a well-formed mouth, and no scars marked him. His black hair, unkempt from life in the field, hung beside his face in slight waves. His beard showed only a stubble, meaning that normally he was clean-shaven.<br><br>She regretted that his eyes were closed. They were remarkable eyes, dark and bright and expressive beneath their straight brows. When he smiled they sparkled like black diamonds and when he frowned a different, deeper fire burned in them. They were almost mesmerizing. Since she and Ascanio had entered the longhouse they were almost the only thing she had seen when she looked at this knight.<br><br>She had no interest in men as lovers or husbands, but she was not immune to male beauty. She could enjoy it, briefly and analytically, the way she enjoyed the colorful paintings in some of the Mother Abbess's books. This was a stunningly handsome man. She looked at him a long time before she rested her head against the side of the straw mattress.<br><br>Anna woke him with a touch to his shoulder. &#x201c;He is gone. It was peaceful.&#x201d;<br><br>Morvan went over and looked down on the wasted body. &#x201c;It happened very fast. He appeared well yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes it goes like this. We sent some villagers to prepare a grave. It is consecrated ground. Put him on your horse, and we will walk there.&#x201d;</p><h2>What Am I Going To Do With All My STUFF?</h2><p>"What am I Going to Do with All My STUFF?" by Julie Hall, The Estate Lady� offers options, resources, and best practices for the downsizing process.Garages, storage units, and attics are full of stuff because most people don't know how to let go and they have no idea where to begin to simplify their living space.

But I didn&#x2019;t have enormous talent. Some people believed I did because I wrote poems and was shy, didn&#x2019;t make eye contact, kept to myself. (Nowadays you&#x2019;d say &#x201c;high-functioning end of the autism spectrum,&#x201d; but back in the day oddity was interpreted differently.). Anyway, death didn&#x2019;t occur. I never needed to charter a plane in a snowstorm as Buddy did, and a car like James Dean&#x2019;s Porsche 550 Spyder was way beyond my means, and heroin was not readily available in Anoka, Minnesota, so onward I went. I had a lot to think about other than immortality&#x2014;sex, of course, and how to avoid going to Vietnam and dying young in a stupid war, and then I started a radio show called A Prairie Home Companion, which ate up all my time&#x2014;a man has to work awfully hard to make up for lack of talent&#x2014;and suddenly I was forty, which is too old to die young, so I forgot about it and headed down the long dirt road of longevity, and thus arrived at seventy, when I took time to sit down and read my own work and see what is what.</p><p>I started out with No. 2 pencil and pads of paper, then acquired an Underwood manual typewriter with a faint f and a misshapen O. You had to poke the keys hard to make an impression. I set it on a maple desk in my bedroom, which looked out onto a cornfield across the road, and I wrote stories about tortured loners who stood at a distance from the crowd and observed their comings and goings with envy tinged with contempt. Or contempt tinged with envy. My parents did not encourage literary aspirations: I was the third of six children of John and Grace, a young Sanctified Brethren couple in Anoka, Minnesota, on the Mississippi, a farm boy and a city girl who eloped and married secretly against opposition from both their families. We have a premarital picture of them on a summer day in a backyard in Minneapolis, looking very dreamy. The Brethren did not read novels or poetry and were wary of history, except what was in Scripture, but they offered a rich supply of contempt. They were the Faithful Remnant, maintaining the pure flame of God&#x2019;s Word abandoned by the rest of Christianity. I grew up along the river in Brooklyn Park township, where we moved in 1947 into a house Dad built on an acre lot with room for a big garden. All around us were vegetable farms, fields of corn, peas, onions, potatoes. My brother and sister and I attended Benson School, a handsome three-room country school, where I had Estelle Shaver and Fern Moehlenbrock for teachers. In first grade, I was slow to read, and Miss Shaver kept me after school to read aloud to her, which she made me believe was not for my sake, but for hers, to keep her company as she graded papers. She said to Bill the janitor, &#x201c;Listen to him, doesn&#x2019;t he have a lovely voice.&#x201d; In time, I turned into a bookworm and a good speller. At age eleven, after I dropped an easy fly ball during recess, I asked Miss Moehlenbrock&#x2019;s permission to spend recess in the library, reading history books, a turning point in my life. Instead of vying for the respect of other boys, I sought out the company of old uncles and asked them about the war and the thirties and why did Grandpa Denham come over from Scotland in 1905 and why did Grandpa Keillor come down from New Brunswick in 1880? The old uncles were very grateful for a boy&#x2019;s interest. All I had to do was ask a few questions and sit and listen. They thought I was definitely gifted. It was so much easier to ingratiate myself with them than to impress my peers. My peers thought I was strange. I didn&#x2019;t mind. I won the class spelling bee that spring, beating out Billy Pedersen on the word veracity.</p><p>The summer before eighth grade, I walked into the office of the Anoka Herald, a down-at-the-heels weekly around the corner from the junior high, and asked the editor, Warren Feist, if I could write sports for him, assuming he&#x2019;d laugh and say no. It was an act of reckless bravery by a fearful young man, and Mr. Feist was very kind. He smiled and said, &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; So I got to sit in the press box at football games, high above the crowd, and look reporterly as I took extensive notes on each play. Back at the office&#x2014;thirteen years old, I had an office&#x2014;Whitey and Russ sat at the keyboards of their monster Linotype machines, with a little flame in back keeping the melted lead hot. Line by line, they clattered away at the stories, pulling the lever that poured the hot lead into the mold to make a slug. I banged out my stories and handed the yellow copy paper to Russ, who typeset them. He and Whitey were both heavy drinkers, pasty-faced with purple noses, and the paper languished in the shadow of the competing County Union. But I was thrilled to be there. Mr. Feist edited my stories gently, removing paragraphs of crowd description, drawing out the action on the field. The Herald was printed on Wednesday afternoon and I made a point to be there to watch. Whitey stood on a platform over the flatbed press and, though he was drunk, he could take a sheet of paper the size of a cafeteria table, shake it loose from the stack, and then flip it up and onto the flatbed, where the roller rolled over it with a whump and a shwoosh and the folder cut and trimmed and folded it, and a copy of the Herald slid down the chute with the sports page and my name, my story about the Anoka Tornadoes ready to be read by dozens, if not hundreds, of subscribers, men and women in kitchens all over Anoka absorbed in my account of the game. It was thrilling then and still is, years later, seeing your own words in print.</p><p>My parents were dismayed by newspapering. My mother said that writers were a bunch of drunks, meaning F. Scott Fitzgerald. As a young woman, she had lived near his old neighborhood in St. Paul and heard stories. She also knew that Hemingway, Faulkner, O&#x2019;Neill, Tennessee Williams, and Dylan Thomas all drank a lot. People went to Thomas&#x2019;s readings to see if he could remain standing and not drop a cigarette down his pants and set himself on fire. She had read about that somewhere.</p><p>As Sanctified Brethren born and bred, they were not sympathetic to the writing life. They cleaved to the literal truth of Holy Scripture and pored over the Word, trying to discern the Lord&#x2019;s Will. That was the writing that mattered and everything else was vanity and horsefeathers. The Lord wanted us to be watchful, waiting for His Glorious Return, not making up stories. We sat in the Gospel Hall on Fourteenth Avenue South in Minneapolis, perusing Deuteronomy, led by my Uncle Don, who felt that God&#x2019;s instructions to the Jews wandering in the wilderness had relevance for us. The Bible was awfully exciting to read if you believed it was entirely true&#x2014;as great literature, it was not bad, but as revelation, it was a wild ride. I was a devout young man, at least in my own heart, and asked to be baptized when I was fourteen, and waded out into the waters with Brother John Rogers as the Brethren sang a hymn. When I was twenty, I abandoned them. I thought that probably they were right, that it was sinful to want to be a writer, but I wanted to do it anyway. It was all I really wanted. A good Christian was supposed to sacrifice his desires to the Lord. I chose not to.</p><p>In 1960 I went off to be an English major at the University of Minnesota, where John Berryman, James Wright, and Allen Tate taught. My parents were not pleased, but I didn&#x2019;t ask for their help and so they had no say about it. I owned three cardboard boxes of stuff including a Webster&#x2019;s Third Unabridged and an Underwood typewriter. Hiking around campus in blue jeans, white shirt, corduroy jacket with elbow patches, Red Wing work boots, and a broad-brimmed hat, with a pack of Camels or Marlboros in my pocket, I felt obliged to smoke at least one pack of cigarettes every day, two if I could afford them, and drink coffee by the gallon, because that&#x2019;s what writers do. Back then, a cup of coffee was two bits, a pack of smokes cost 35 cents, and a drink was a dollar. I supported myself by washing dishes and parking cars, both of them formative experiences. You work the morning shift in the heat and steam of the scullery and you feel clean and contented the rest of the day. You stand on a gravel parking lot on the high bluff of the Mississippi, the wintry blast sweeping down the valley, and you direct a stream of cars to their correct spots in straight lines, tolerating no dissent or diversion, stomping out individual preference wherever it occurs, and you discover the fascist storm trooper within yourself. Good to know one&#x2019;s own capacity.</p><p>Mr. Tate was sixty-eight when I took his poetry seminar. A slim, elegant man with a Southern patrician accent&#x2014;a pal of Robert Penn Warren and Hart Crane&#x2014;he chain-smoked in class, so we did, too. The whole English Department reeked of tobacco smoke and was proudly alcoholic&#x2014; anyone who wasn&#x2019;t was considered an interloper, possibly a Mormon. James Wright chain-smoked through his lectures on Dickens and Whitman, which he delivered through a haze of hangover. He always looked pale and haggard. His line &#x201c;Suddenly I realize that if I stepped out of my body, I would break into blossom&#x201d; was written by a man with smoke coming out of his mouth.</p><p>My hero, Saul Bellow (The Adventures of Augie March), had recently taught at the U and I liked hearing about him from his pal, my advisor, Joe Kwiat, a big, hearty guy with a great bark of a voice. Snowy-haired Robert Frost came and filled Northrup Auditorium, 4,700 seats, and recited his greatest hits by heart. I was in a crowd of students who stood by the back door and watched him emerge and shuffle down the walk and climb into his limousine. Our great drunken genius was John Berryman, the poet and wildly brilliant lecturer, a man of such towering intellect that I was afraid to be in the same room with him&#x2014;one caustic word, even a disapproving glance, and I would&#x2019;ve gone up in flames. He wore a big beard that made him look like he was eating his sweater. He gave readings of his Dream Songs at which his speech was slurred, he slumped against the lectern, lurching into flights of reminiscence, muttering asides to friends in the audience, a man on the verge of collapse. His greatness and his affliction seemed intertwined, a true artist engaging with dark forces in his own body in full public view. Fate had driven him to this condition, just as it had driven him to create poetry, and he could no more give up one than he could stifle the other. And I, fearful of embarrassing myself in public, was clearly incapable of this greatness.</p><p>If the true sign of brilliance is to be seriously screwed up, stalked by livid demons, fatally wounded, then I was, compared to Berryman, a dullard and a dolt. My dad had not committed suicide with a shotgun outside my bedroom window when I was twelve. Berryman&#x2019;s had. Mine simply worked hard. My boyhood may have appeared strict and narrow&#x2014;no dancing, drinking, smoking, moviegoing, card playing, no rough talk or profanity&#x2014;but my Brethren were people of great kindness, most of them related to me. I was quite at home among them.</p><p>So I accepted that I would never be a true artist and that my future lay in being amusing. For the campus literary magazine, The Ivory Tower, I wrote stuff that owed much to Benchley and Thurber, A. J. Liebling and E. B. White. My journalism teacher, Bob Lindsay, encouraged this. He was a Marine Corps captain&#x2014;a veteran of two wars, his bald head had a noticeable dent in it, as if a mortar shell had bounced off it&#x2014;and he was a no-nonsense teacher. In his class, one spelling mistake on a writing assignment, no matter how elegant, earned you an F. We were horrified to hear this. But we learned to copyread, a skill that sticks with you for life. Mr. Lindsay&#x2019;s office was on the first floor of Murphy Hall, and whenever I walked down the hall, I slowed down, and if his door was open and he didn&#x2019;t have a visitor, I stuck my head in. He was brusque, not given to b.s., and when he said I should try to catch on at The New Yorker, that was pure gold. And then, unbeknownst to me, he sent the magazine a few pieces of mine from the Tower and a letter attesting to my good character.</p><p>I had not told him that I had written to my draft board and said I would not report for induction into the U.S. Army, as I&#x2019;d been ordered to do. Vietnam was on every young man&#x2019;s mind and I waited for the FBI to knock on my door and they didn&#x2019;t. Evidently someone at the draft board office stuck my file in a dark place and thereby put herself in danger&#x2014;it is a felony to conceal or otherwise impair the availability of a governmental record&#x2014;and whoever did that deed was braver than I. I owe her a large debt and wish I knew who she is.</p><p>In 1966, I spent July and August in New York, holed up in a boarding-house on West Nineteethth Street in a poor Hispanic neighborhood near the Episcopal seminary, and thought about staying permanently. The boardinghouse was cheap: breakfast and dinner along with a room for $75 a week. The clientele was about half recent patients from mental hospitals, doped up on Thorazine, a quiet bunch, who sat in the garden under ailanthus trees listening to the nuns in a nearby convent chanting in Spanish. I was supposed to marry a girl in September, a big wedding in a Methodist church with four bridesmaids in bronze taffeta and country-club reception&#x2014;it was all planned&#x2014;and I wanted to escape. I felt like a jerk, abandoning her and her family, who had been so good to me, but I was hearing warning bells&#x2014;there was a large vacancy between her and me. New York seemed like a good move, what with marriage and the FBI way on my trail. I knew an artist named Irving who drove a cab by night and shot photographs by day, and I hung out with him. He was screwed up, as a true artist should be, he dropped acid, smoked dope, and lived in a one-bedroom fourth-floor walk-up on the Lower East Side with his wife and two baby girls in such poverty as I knew I hadn&#x2019;t the strength of character to endure. Tiny dim rooms, summer heat, city clangor, sink full of dirty dishes, weeping infants, a bitter wife. New York was a dark swamp where a man could walk deeper and deeper into the muck and disappear and nobody would notice. But what was waiting for me back in Minnesota? I tried to write a piece for The New Yorker that romanticized life on Nineteenth Street as operatic, flamboyant, exotic, people yelling at each other in Spanish, and took it to their offices on West Forty-third, where a very nice woman named Patricia Mosher read it and told me to keep in touch. I took a bus to Boston to interview at the Atlantic. An overnight bus, to save on hotel. Got to the Atlantic office on Arlington Street an hour early and went to the men&#x2019;s toilet, stood at the sink, took off my shirt, and sort of bathed and dried myself with paper towels, and a man in a suit came in, stood at the urinal, and made a point of not looking at me. He, as it turned out, was the man who would be interviewing me.

Borden and Roger W. Brucker provide gripping first-person accounts of the discoveries, including Roppel Cave, that made Kentucky&#x2019; s Mammoth Cave three times longer than any other cave in the world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Borden, a relative newcomer, and Brucker, a veteran explorer, bring a personal and sometimes conflicting view of their roles as adversaries in a race that lasted from 1972 through 1983 to find &#x201c; big cave.&#x201d; They describe hazardous adventures, precarious climbs, and close calls from falling rocks. The perils are many and the trek arduous as they squirm through muddy tubes, wade in neck-deep cold water, and crawl over sharp rocks and gritty sand. Theirs is a tale of agonizing endurance spiced by spectacular discoveries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But the cave was not the sole obstacle. The explorations were complicated by political intrigue and the rivalry between the Kentucky-based Cave Research Foundation and the Central Kentucky Karst Coalition, each seeking to make discoveries and hide secrets. Extreme stress, of course, evoked extreme behavior, ranging from selfishness to sacrifice, from outrageous humor to the deadly serious response. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><i>Beyond Mammoth Cave </i>includes maps by Patricia Kambesis that show the progression of cave discoveries in relation to the topography.

Du Bois Lectures)</h2><p><p>African American literature is over. With this provocative claim <b>Kenneth Warren</b> sets out to identify a distinctly African American literature&#x2015;and to change the terms with which we discuss it.</p><p>Rather than contest other definitions, Warren makes a clear and compelling case for understanding African American literature as creative and critical work written by black Americans within and against the strictures of Jim Crow America. Within these parameters, his book outlines protocols of reading that best make sense of the literary works produced by African American writers and critics over the first two-thirds of the twentieth century.</p><p>In Warren&#x2019;s view, African American literature begged the question: what would happen to this literature if and when Jim Crow was finally overthrown? Thus, imagining a world without African American literature was essential to that literature. In support of this point, Warren focuses on three moments in the history of Phylon, an important journal of African American culture. In the dialogues Phylon documents, the question of whether race would disappear as an organizing literary category emerges as shared ground for critical and literary practice. Warren also points out that while scholarship by black Americans has always been the province of a petit bourgeois elite, the strictures of Jim Crow enlisted these writers in a politics that served the race as a whole.</p><p>Finally, Warren&#x2019;s work sheds light on the current moment in which advocates of African American solidarity insist on a past that is more productively put behind us.</p></p><p>Kenneth W. Warren is Fairfax M. Cone Distinguished Service Professor of English at the University of Chicago.&#x201c;Is the idea that sustains the possibility of an African American literature today the belief that the welfare of the race as a whole depends on the success of black writers and those who are depicted in their texts, as Ken Warren suggests in this provocative new book? In compelling close readings of novels from George Schuyler's Black No More to Michael Thomas's Man Gone Down and in comprehensive engagements with major tendencies in literary criticism, <i>What Was African American Literature?</i> punctures contemporary assumptions about the role of black literature since the end of the Jim Crow regime that, Warren argues, provoked the literature's emergence in the first place.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Werner Sollors, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>What Was African American Literature?</i> is undoubtedly one of the most provocative books on the texts and criticism of African American literature to appear within the past several years. The sophistication and range of its arguments further cement Warren's stature as one of the leading thinkers of our time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Gene Jarrett, Boston University</b><br><br>&#x201c;A slight but forceful text with a pugnacious and elegantly presented thesis.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Most literary criticism today, under the sign of theory, is obscure and incomprehensible, and shies from presenting daring new ways to look at literature--when it engages with contemporary literature at all.

He came from a strong Christian family and he developed a love for reading books. At fifteen, a stormy day changed his plans and he went to a Methodist chapel in Colchester, where the service was almost given up for low attendance. At this service the message was look to Jesus to be saved, and he became a Christian. He never went to college, but he became a scholar through self-study. His parents were Congregationalists but he saw the need for Baptism after he read the Bible. He preached his first sermon at Teversham in Cambridgeshire and people began to respect him. The New Park Street Chapel in London was deserted and the young man from Cambridge was recommended. Spurgeon thought it a mistake and that he would not be fit for London. He was &#x201c;borne down with a sense of weakness.&#x201d; His preaching was blessed with great success of effect and attendance. Soon the need of a much larger building was needed and the Metropolitan Tabernacle was built in 1861. He became a well-known preacher and is regarded as the &#x201c;Prince of Preachers.&#x201d;</p><h2>Bursting at the Seams (10) (Sew Zoey)</h2><p>Zoey&#x2019;s aunt is throwing a surprise wedding, and wants Zoey to make her dress!

So, remember when the dress I designed for Bryn Allen was on the cover of Celebrity magazine? I do! In fact, it&#x2019;s hard to forget. Since then, I&#x2019;ve been getting some e-mails and requests through my Sew Zoey store for more runway looks. I&#x2019;m not sure that&#x2019;s my speed, exactly, but here&#x2019;s a design that could look great on someone young, without showing too much. The problem is that making it would probably take me thirty or forty hours, which is a lot for one dress! I&#x2019;d need a nice, long vacation afterward. <br> <br>And speaking of vacations . . . my most favorite aunt, Lulu, is finally back in town after a romantic Caribbean getaway with her (dum dee dum) new fianc�! She and John got engaged while they were on their trip. I&#x2019;m meeting her for tea and cupcakes after school to get all the juicy details. I&#x2019;m SEW pumped to see her!<br> <br><br> <br>Zoey Webber was in heaven. She was at her favorite caf�, Tea Time, with a cup of oolong tea, a pink frosted cupcake, and her aunt Lulu. Lulu was tanned and smiling as she drizzled honey into her English breakfast tea and stirred it with a spoon.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me everything,&#x201d; Zoey said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave anything out! I want to feel like I was there too!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu laughed, and began to unwrap the bag that held her croissant. &#x201c;Well, it was pretty magical. Everything about Barbados is magical, really. John and I were out to dinner at a beautiful restaurant built on a cliff at the edge of the ocean. We were watching tiny nurse sharks swim up for chum the restaurant throws them, and when I looked away from the sharks, John was kneeling beside me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d; urged Zoey. She was so enthralled with the story, she hadn&#x2019;t even touched her tea or her cupcake yet. &#x201c;Did you say yes immediately, or did you cry, or what?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu laughed again. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just say my eyes were teary, but I was so happy. And I said yes right away. I think I might have even shouted it. The people sitting at tables around us applauded, and that was it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sounds perfect.&#x201d; Zoey sighed with satisfaction. The story was exactly what she would have wished for her aunt, who had always been more of a second mother to Zoey since her own mom had passed away when she was very little. Although it had been somewhat hard for Zoey when Lulu and John had first begun dating, because she&#x2019;d been worried she&#x2019;d lose her special place in Lulu&#x2019;s life, that hadn&#x2019;t happened at all. Zoey felt sure that adding John Chadden to their family would make things even better.<br> <br>With the proposal story out of the way, Zoey bit into her cupcake with enthusiasm. It was Friday afternoon, and a long and busy week at school had made her ravenous. She was so intent on her cupcake, in fact, that she didn&#x2019;t notice Lulu wasn&#x2019;t touching her own croissant.<br> <br>When Zoey finally looked up, Lulu was leaning forward in her seat, her eyes bright and her lips clamped together. A smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Zoey asked. &#x201c;Why are you looking at me like that?&#x201d; Self-conscious, Zoey wiped at her mouth with a napkin, in case she was covered in extra frosting.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a tiny bit more to the story . . . ,&#x201d; Lulu said. She giggled and then clapped a hand over her mouth to stop. &#x201c;But before I tell you, you have to swear to keep it a secret.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey felt her heart begin to pound. More to the story? Like what? Her aunt was acting very strangely, and not at all like the calm, cool interior designer and business owner that she was.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell me!&#x201d; Zoey exclaimed.<br> <br>Lulu placed her hands on either side of the caf� table, as if to anchor herself so she wouldn&#x2019;t fall over, and whispered, &#x201c;John and I are having a surprise wedding, and it&#x2019;s in three weeks!&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey stared at her aunt, her mouth hanging open. A surprise wedding? What on Earth was that? In three weeks?<br> <br>Zoey shook her head, unable to spit out a sentence. All she could mumble was &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>Aunt Lulu giggled again, her sparkling eyes and flushed cheeks making her look every bit the happy and excited bride-to-be. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve decided to invite our close friends and family to a little &#x2018;engagement party&#x2019; at my house in a few weeks. At least, that&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;ll think. But when everyone arrives, we&#x2019;re really going to surprise them and tell them we&#x2019;ll be getting married that night!&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey had never heard of a surprise wedding. &#x201c;So the wedding, the actual wedding where you say your vows, is in three weeks at your house, but no one will know except you and John and me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu nodded. &#x201c;And a few other close family members, like your dad and brother. And the vendors. We&#x2019;ll have a caterer and a cake and flowers and a photographer, like a normal wedding. But it&#x2019;ll all just be a little more casual and fun, since it&#x2019;ll be at my house and no one will expect it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey&#x2019;s mind reeled with the possibilities. No church, no big reception hall. No waiting months and months for the big day. A surprise wedding for her aunt, in just three weeks. And she was one of the few in on the secret!<br> <br>&#x201c;I LOVE IT!&#x201d; Zoey screeched, and several people in the caf� turned to glance at her. Lulu and Zoey looked at each other and grinned. &#x201c;I really do, Aunt Lulu. This is so you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu winked at her. &#x201c;Exactly. John and I have both been married before, and we didn&#x2019;t want to do the big wedding thing again. We love each other, and we want to start our life together now. And the surprise just makes it so much more fun!&#x201d; She paused, taking a sip of her tea and then carefully placing the teacup back on its saucer. &#x201c;And there&#x2019;s something very special I&#x2019;d like to ask you, Zoey.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure I can take any more exciting news, Aunt Lulu,&#x201d; Zoey said honestly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already on a sugar high from the cupcake, and now I know the biggest secret ever!&#x201d;<br> <br>Aunt Lulu put her hand over Zoey&#x2019;s and squeezed it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like you to be my junior bridesmaid, honey. And I&#x2019;d really love it if you&#x2019;d come shopping with me and help me pick out my dress.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey was honored. Truly honored. She&#x2019;d get to stand up with her aunt at the wedding and help find the dress. It was a dream come true!<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course, yes to both!&#x201d; Zoey said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My maid of honor will be my best friend, Sybil, but since she lives in Atlanta, she won&#x2019;t be here to shop with me. I&#x2019;d like for you and her to wear dresses that coordinate, at least in color. She&#x2019;ll buy hers, but I think it would be wonderful if you designed and made your own junior bridesmaid&#x2019;s dress.&#x201d;<br> <br>Design my own junior bridesmaid&#x2019;s dress? Zoey was flabbergasted. With that final piece of exciting news, Zoey jumped up from her seat and threw her arms around her aunt. What could be more fun? She&#x2019;d make the most beautiful junior bridesmaid&#x2019;s dress in the world!<br> <br>Aunt Lulu hugged Zoey back, smoothing Zoey&#x2019;s hair with one hand. &#x201c;I take it that&#x2019;s a yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey nodded and gave her aunt one more big squeeze before returning to her seat. A really good afternoon for Zoey was a cupcake and conversation with her aunt. Hearing about a wedding proposal made it extra special. Finding out about a secret wedding made it unbelievable. Hearing that she&#x2019;d be a junior bridesmaid and get to design her own dress? Zoey didn&#x2019;t have a word for it.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think I might burst,&#x201d; she told Lulu. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to burst right through the walls of Tea Time.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu chuckled. &#x201c;Well, if possible, don&#x2019;t. And remember, the only people you can discuss this with are Marcus and your father. We have to keep it a secret so that the surprise works. It&#x2019;s very important to John and me. Promise?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey nodded. &#x201c;I promise,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>She had no idea how difficult that promise would be to keep.<br> <br><br> <br>The next morning, Lulu picked up Zoey, and they drove to a fancy bridal salon. Zoey had never been wedding dress shopping before, and she couldn&#x2019;t even remember the last wedding she&#x2019;d attended. Probably her cousin&#x2019;s wedding when Zoey was about seven. She had no idea what to expect when they walked in.<br> <br>A chic, middle-aged woman in a fitted black suit approached them. &#x201c;Good morning. Do you have an appointment?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m Lulu Price,&#x201d; Aunt Lulu said.<br> <br>The woman checked a clipboard, nodded, and ushered them back to a large round room, with racks and racks of gorgeous dresses on display, and a wall of dressing rooms on one side.<br> <br>The consultant, Deirdre, gave Lulu a quick tour of the gowns, showing her how they were grouped by price. &#x201c;And when is your wedding?&#x201d; Deirdre asked, making notes on her clipboard.<br> <br>With slightly pink cheeks, Lulu explained she was having a surprise wedding at her house in just three weeks, and she wanted something not too formal, but elegant, and that it needed to be ready to purchase and alter immediately.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three weeks?&#x201d; Deirdre repeated. &#x201c;Three weeks?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey&#x2019;s eyes swiveled from Lulu to Deirdre and back to Lulu. What was the big deal about three weeks?<br> <br>Lulu simply nodded, and said firmly, &#x201c;Yes, three weeks. What do you have that&#x2019;s ready to wear?&#x201d;<br> <br>Deirdre wrinkled her brow a moment, and looked worried, but then her face seemed to relax. &#x201c;I love a challenge,&#x201d; she told Lulu. &#x201c;Go into the dressing room, please, and I&#x2019;ll bring you some sample dresses available for purchase, and also a few of our consignment dresses. They can all go home with you immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu sighed with relief, and she and Zoey headed to the dressing room.<br> <br>Zoey whispered to her aunt, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize you couldn&#x2019;t buy a wedding dress off the rack,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the big deal?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu explained. &#x201c;Most wedding dresses are made to order. So you go to a bridal store, try on a sample, and then they order it in your size. When it comes in, which can take months, you usually have to alter it some. That&#x2019;s what happened with my first wedding. But we don&#x2019;t have time for that now, so I&#x2019;ll just have to take what I can get.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey sat, slightly worried. She wanted her aunt to have the perfect dress. She didn&#x2019;t want her to have to settle for whatever samples or consignment dresses were available that very second.<br> <br>Deirdre knocked and came into the dressing room, her arms full of gowns. They were beautiful, every one of them, and varied from silk chiffon to tulle to lace.<br> <br>Aunt Lulu began trying them on. Luckily, she wore a standard dress size, and was able to fit into most of the samples. The first dress, a strapless silk chiffon with seed pearls and sequins, was too formal for a fall wedding in someone&#x2019;s backyard. The second, a voluminous ball gown, had a skirt so wide, it would never fit through the front door of Lulu&#x2019;s house. The third was a possibility, with wide straps, a square d�colletage, and a smooth flowy skirt. It wasn&#x2019;t too formal, and it looked appropriate for a surprise wedding at home. But, unfortunately, Lulu was a bit on the tall side, and the dress was three inches too short, even without heels, and the hem wasn&#x2019;t quite long enough to let down.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no fixing a too-short dress,&#x201d; Lulu said with a groan. &#x201c;Too long would have been a better problem.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You could cut it and make it knee-length?&#x201d; Zoey suggested. She was starting to feel discouraged by Lulu&#x2019;s limited options.<br> <br>&#x201c;I really want a long dress,&#x201d; Lulu said. &#x201c;In fact, I really like the top of this dress, but with the bottom of that first one. It&#x2019;s too bad it&#x2019;s not like magnetic dress-up dolls where you can mix and match!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu tried on several more dresses, but none of them were right either. Everything was either too formal or fit poorly. Finally, she looked at Zoey, and blinked. &#x201c;I think we&#x2019;ve struck out,&#x201d; she said dejectedly.<br> <br>Zoey&#x2019;s mind raced. They had to find a dress for Lulu. They had to!<br> <br>&#x201c;What if . . . ,&#x201d; Zoey began, an idea forming in her mind. &#x201c;What if I were to sketch the top of the dress you liked, with the bottom of that other one, and you gave the sketch to a wedding seamstress and they made it for you? Could that work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a terrific idea, Zoey,&#x201d; said Lulu. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m afraid I tried that first! I called my regular seamstress as soon as we got back from Barbados, but she was booked solid. She even gave me some other people to try, but none of them had availability to make a dress so fast. That&#x2019;s why I thought I&#x2019;d make do with a sample dress.&#x201d;<br> <br>Deirdre knocked on the dressing room door, and Lulu opened it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid that&#x2019;s all we have available in your size that could be ready in time,&#x201d; Deirdre said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so terribly sorry! I can call you if we get any new consignment gowns in this week or next.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Lulu said. &#x201c;Something will work out, I&#x2019;m sure. I can always look online.&#x201d;<br> <br>Deirdre removed the dresses, and Lulu put her regular clothes back on. She and Zoey left the store, packed with beautiful wedding gowns that wouldn&#x2019;t be ready in time for Lulu&#x2019;s big day.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you going to do?&#x201d; Zoey asked her aunt.<br> <br>Lulu stopped walking and turned to Zoey. &#x201c;Zoey,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I know this is a lot to ask, especially with you being so busy with school, but is there any way you&#x2019;d have time to make a dress for me? We could keep the design really simple, but it&#x2019;s the only way I can get what I want in time for the wedding! And it would mean so much to me to wear an original Sew Zoey dress on my wedding day.&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey couldn&#x2019;t believe her ears. Her aunt wanted her to make her wedding dress? The most important dress of her life?<br> <br>&#x201c;But, Aunt Lulu, I don&#x2019;t know anything about wedding dresses! I didn&#x2019;t even know you had to order them! I wouldn&#x2019;t know where to start.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll design it together. Just think of it as a simple white dress. And you know a lot more than you think you do, my talented niece. Wasn&#x2019;t an outfit you made just on the cover of Celebrity magazine?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, yes.&#x201d; Zoey blushed. She was so honored that her aunt would even ask. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to, Aunt Lulu. I&#x2019;d really, really love to!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu hugged her and said, &#x201c;This will be great, Zoey. Really special. It fits our surprise wedding theme, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zoey agreed. It was sort of perfect.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you think about the dresses we liked today and come up with a sketch or two? Something that won&#x2019;t be too hard for you to make so fast. And one more thing: I&#x2019;ll need the skirt fabric to be stretchy if it&#x2019;s fitted, because John and I plan to surprise everyone with a tango for our first dance, since we met in ballroom dance class.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay!&#x201d; agreed Zoey. &#x201c;I already have some ideas from what we saw. And I began sketching some designs for my junior bridesmaid&#x2019;s dress last night. Maybe you should take me home now so I can get to work. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu nodded. &#x201c;Sure thing. Do you still want to come with me tomorrow for a cupcake tasting, flowers, and stationery?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, and yes!&#x201d; said Zoey. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to miss anything!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lulu and Zoey linked arms and then headed for the car. They had a lot of work to do.</p><h2>The Poetry Deal (San Francisco Poet Laureate Series, 7)</h2><p>"<i>The Poetry Deal</i> shines with eros and kindness and the reality of inspiration.

Often elegiac in tone, the book captures the poet's sense of loss as she chronicles the deaths of friends from the AIDS epidemic as well as the passing of illustrious countercultural colleagues like Philip Whalen, Pigpen from the Grateful Dead, and Kirby Doyle. She also recalls and mourns out-of-town inspirations like Ch�gyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Audre Lorde, and Ezra Pound. Yet even as she laments the state of her city today, she finds triumph and solace in her own relationships, the marriages of her friends, the endurance of City Lights, and other symbols of San Francisco's heritage.<br><br>Born in Brooklyn in 1934, <b>Diane di Prima</b> emerged as a member of the Beat Generation in New York in the late '50s; in the early '60s, she founded the important mimeo magazine <i>The Floating Bear</i> with her lover LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka).

The length of the dynasties varied: some, such as those during the First and Second Intermediate periods could be quite short, while the Thirteenth and 18th Dynasties each contained more a one dozen kings and ruled over the Nile Valley for around 200 years each. Although the first 20 Egyptian dynasties varied in number of rulers and length, most shared one important attribute: they were all native Egyptian dynasties. The one important exception came during Egypt&#x2019;s Second Intermediate Period, when a mysterious foreign group of people, known as the Hyksos, conquered Egypt and established the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Dynasties some time shortly after 1700 BCE. For centuries, the Hyksos rule over Egypt was an enigma shrouded in half-truths and myth. The Hyksos were sometimes mistakenly associated with the biblical Israelites, but were for the most part forgotten in modern times due to the dearth of written texts that can be dated to their rule. It was only in the mid-20th century that Egyptologists, using newly discovered and translated texts, shed fresh light on the Hyksos to reveal details about their origins and rule in Egypt. An examination reveals that although the Hyksos were initially foreign to Egypt, they probably did not come from too far, and once they did establish themselves as rulers, a degree of acculturation then took place, until the foreign rulers became gradually more &#x201c;Egyptianized&#x201d; themselves. Eventually, the Hyksos were driven from the Nile Valley by the native Egyptians, but their influence continued to resonate in Egypt for centuries. For example, the Egyptians adapted some of the successful warfare techniques that they learned from the Hyksos in order to establish their New Kingdom Empire in the 18th Dynasty. Later, the Hyksos proved to be a good foil or &#x201c;bogeyman&#x201d; for Egyptian literature in the New Kingdom and Late Period. Truly, the Hyksos may not have ruled Egypt for a long period, but their regime left a resounding impression on Egyptian society for centuries. The Hyksos: The History of the Foreign Invaders Who Conquered Ancient Egypt and Established the Fifteenth Dynasty looks at the controversial and mysterious history of the group that conquered Egypt and established a new dynasty there in the middle of the 2nd millennium BCEE. Along with pictures depicting important people, places, and events, you will learn about the Hyksos like never before.</p><p></p><h2>When the Soldiers Came to Town: Spartanburg&#39;s Camp Wadsworth, 1917-1919, and Camp Croft, 1941-1945</h2><p>During World War I and World War II, more than 350,000 men on their way to battlefields abroad came to Spartanburg to learn to be soldiers at the training camps of Wadsworth and Croft. The story of how wartime preparation changed them, and how they in turn changed Spartanburg, is the focus of Hub City&#x2019;s When the Soldiers Came to Town, a lively, illustrated history edited by Susan Turpin, Carolyn Creal, Ron Crawley, and James Crocker.<br>Few traces remain of the 2,000-acre Wadsworth training facility and the 20,000-acre Croft complex.

She was four years old. Marina Chapman was stolen from her housing estate and then abandoned deep in the Colombian jungle. That she survived is a miracle. Two days later, half-drugged, terrified, and starving, she came upon a troop of capuchin monkeys. Acting entirely on instinct, she tried to do what they did: she ate what they ate and copied their actions, and little by little, learned to fend for herself.</p><p>So begins the story of her five years among the monkeys, during which time she gradually became feral; she lost the ability to speak, lost all inhibition, lost any real sense of being human, replacing the structure of human society with the social mores of her new simian family. But society was eventually to reclaim her. At age ten she was discovered by a pair of hunters who took her to the lawless Colombian city of Cucuta where, in exchange for a parrot, they sold her to a brothel. When she learned that she was to be groomed for prostitution, she made her plans to escape. But her adventure wasn&#x2019;t over yet...</p> In the vein of "Slumdog Millionaire" and "City of God," this rousing story of a lost child who overcomes the dangers of the wild and the brutality of the streets to finally reclaim her life will astonish readers everywhere.<br></p><p><p>Now married to an Englishman and living in Bradford, England, <strong>Marina Chapman</strong> plans to donate her share of the profits from this book to help finance charities that combat human trafficking and child slavery in Colombia.</p><p>Based in Wales, co-author <strong>Lynne Barrett-Lee</strong>'s first novel, <em>Julia Gets a Life</em>, was published by Bantam. Her most recent novel, <em>Barefoot in the Dark</em>, was shortlisted for the inaugural Melissa Nathan Award.</p>&#x201c;Chapman tells the harrowing story of her being stolen from her home in Columbia in 1954 at the young age of four by unknown assailants and dropped in the woods to fend for herself. She found comfort and family among a group of monkeys, whose land she happened to stumble upon. The jungle, being an unforgiving place, forced Chapman to learn the ropes quickly, and she found solace in belonging to a group, regardless of species. In fact, as time progressed, she became more comfortable as a monkey than as a human, even being shunned by the indigenous people in the South American jungle. Throughout her time spent in the forest, Chapman learned an important lesson about belonging; &#x201c;Family is not just about who you appear to belong to... or who you look like... [it] is found anywhere you are loved and cared for.&#x201d; Unfortunately, this lesson was demonstrated again and again, as one day the little girl was taken from the jungle and began a more difficult life trying to survive the dangers of a &#x201c;people&#x2019;s world.&#x201d; Sold to a brothel, only to run away and become a street-hustler, then later staying with an abusive Mafioso family, life was not easy for the girl of many names, until finally one woman took pity on her and offered her to a better life. <strong>This book, which is as much a memoir about the importance of classification and belonging as it is about the endurance of the human spirit, will be enjoyed by those looking for a story of perseverance through even the greatest obstacles life brings.</strong>&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><h2>The Portable Henry James (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Henry James wrote with an imperial elegance of style, whether his subjects were American innocents or European sophisticates, incandescent women or their vigorous suitors.

He lived in Newport, went briefly to Harvard Law School, and in 1864 began to contribute both criticism and tales to magazines.<br><br>In 1869, and then in 1872-74, he paid visits to Europe and began his first novel, <b>Roderick Hudson</b>.

She resides in Boston, MA.I'm not a teller of tales, not like the Rhymer. My voice isn't smooth, nor my tongue quick. I know a few tunes, everyone does, but nothing like his: from me you'll never hear songs of gentle maidens fording seven rivers for their false lover so bittersweet as to make the hardest old soldiers weep; nor yet merry ones of rich misers tricked out of their gold, with the twist of a word and a jest so neatly turned that the meanest old uncle that ever pinched a dowry still laughs without offense. Well, it's a power, surely, that music and those words, and I just haven't got it.<br><br>Not that I'm sure I'd take it, even if it were offered me. One of Tom's very tales is of Jock of the Knowe, that was coming home from Mellerstain Fair with a long face, for he'd walked all that way with his old shorthorned cow to sell at the fair, but not a man would have her. So here's Jock returning to his goodwife with no money nor goods, and winter coming on. Jock's going on down Mellerstain road with his cow, and he starts in railing at her, in a temper, like: "What wouldn't I give to be quit of you, and good money in my purse?"<br><br>Well, just then he sees a cloaked man by the side of the road. And the man says, "Good even to you, Jock of the Knowe. And how's the milk from your shorthorned cow?"<br><br>Taking the stranger for some man from the fair, Jock answers, "Why, this cow gives half cream and half honey. And if she gives one bucket at morning, she gives two at evening."<br><br>They fall to bargaining over the price of the cow. It seems to Jock that anyone wandering the roads after the fair in search of a cow must be in a hard case, so he's setting the price high. Then the tall stranger says, "Well, silver is silver, but I can offer you something worth twice that, cow and all." And he pulls out a fiddle.<br><br>Jock says he can't even play, but the stranger says never mind, this fiddle does the playing for you.<br><br>With that Jock sees that this twilight man must be one of Elvenkind. The cow's milk is wanted for some human child they've stolen. Now the fairy gold, if he takes it, could turn to grass and leaves tomorrow. But a magic fiddle's a magic fiddle; wherever you go people will give good money for music. So he says, "I'll take the fiddle."<br><br>And, sure enough, when the exchange is made, the fairy takes the cow, and walks right up to the side of the hill, and raps with his staff three times. And the hill opens up, and fairy and cow disappear into it, right into Elfland.<br><br>As for Jock with his fiddle, he never knows a day's hunger--but he never knows a day's rest, neither, with folk from one end of the country to the other calling on him for music for dances and weddings and such. His goodwife sees only his money, for he's never at home now. Oh, and every Beltane night, which is Fairies' Holiday, Jock goes to that same hillside and plays, and out come a host of gorgeous folk that are the lords and ladies of Elfland, and they dance to Jock's fiddle all night long, until his arms ache and his fingers are sore.<br><br>The way I see it, that's no way to live. He'd have done better to keep the cow.<br><br>But, then, I'm a plain man. A crofter, living high in the hills above Leader Water with one wife, many sheep, few neighbors. I don't even see a cow but twice a year at Earl's Market.<br><br>I'd never seen anything like the Rhymer before he appeared on our doorstep.<br>It was one of those dismal autumn nights, with the wind whistling like a mad huntsman calling up the Hounds of Hell, and you know there's rain toward. And sure enough it came, battering at the roof and shutters, and not a little down the chimney so the fire smoked up the place. But there sat my Meg, nice as you please, sewing at a shirt for her niece's eldest down Rutherford way. I was doing a bit of basketmending, glad that the flock were well penned up already this rough night. Between the rushlight and the fire's glow we could see to work, or maybe it was our fingers remembering the way of it. Lately, light's not as bright as once it was.<br><br>Then the dog at my feet, Tray it would be, son of old Belta that was, Tray goes stiff like he's heard something, though my ears caught nothing over the racket of wind and rain. "Soft, there, lad," I say, like you do to a dog that's spooking. "Easy, lad. Silly hound, scared of a bit of weather."<br><br>My Meg looks up. "Oh, Gavin," she says, her voice strong against the noise of storm. "Gavin, it's a night for the dead to ride, and no mistake."<br><br>She sounded like she was readying to tell one of her tales. Tales go well with dark nights; like the one of that restless spirit, the Lord of Traquair, that rides on stormy nights seeking the wife he murdered in a jealous rage, looking to beg her innocent pardon . . . but her body's long, long in the mold, and her blessed soul in Heaven. It happened not a day's walk from here, across the river, some years gone by.<br><br>"The Wild Hunt rides tonight." Meg's eyes glinted with her eerie tale. "They ride on horses with nostrils like burning coals, chasing the souls of the wicked, that cannot rest for--" Then her head came up sharp. And, "Gavin," she says, "there's knocking at the door."<br><br>I thought her saying it was still part of the tale. Then I heard it too, a thud too regular for wind and rain.<br><br>Tray was growling at my side, his hackles raised. I kept one hand on his head, for there's no telling who might be abroad on such a night: or gypsy, or vagrant, or fiend from Hell. I took light in my other hand, and went and unbarred the door, good Tray by me.<br><br>Standing there was a very tall, very wet hunchback, one shoulder higher than the other under a muddy dripping black cloak. He pushed back his hood as I raised my light to his face. I saw a young man, beardless but stubbled with travel, and dark hair falling into his eyes.<br><br>"Blessings on this house," he says, not the greeting of a Godless man, or one of the Other Ones. Tray growled. "Yes," the stranger says to him, "I've had a pleasant journey, thank you--although it could have been drier. And what do you think of this new fashion in yellow garters?"<br><br>I stared at him. "You're talking to the dog," I said.<br><br>The stranger shook rain out of his eyes. "Well, he spoke to me first. I did not want to be rude. It makes such a bad impression." For all I could see of his face in the flickering light, he meant it.<br><br>"Gavin," Meg calls, "mind the wind blowing in"--which was her way of telling me to stop standing there like a gawk.<br><br>Well, we'd had the stones blessed when we built the house, and rowan over the door against those Others. And it's holy charity to shelter those wit-wandering. So, "Peace to all who enter here," I muttered quickly, and stood aside to let the mad hunchback in.<br><br>"I thank you." He had to dip his head to pass under the lintel. When he drew near the hearth he saw Meg sitting there. Still in his sodden cloak, he made a bow to my goodwife like any queen. I heard the smile in her voice as she said, "Be welcome to the house, harper."<br><br>And, sure enough, he drew the "hump" from off his shoulder: a harp wrapped tight in oilskin. While Meg busied herself wetting a handful of meal for hearthcakes, and setting milk to warm on the fire, he drew off his sodden wool cloak--more mud than wool--and if the house smelt powerful of wet sheep, there was nothing new in that.<br><br>Sometimes when you're doing or thinking on one thing, another comes of a sudden into your mind, or your mind's eye. It was like that then: the man turned to sit down, and suddenly I was seeing the flash of a bright sunny day at Earl's Market, with a woman stuffing a goose, of all things! I looked at our visitor harder. His skin was pale, fine as a maiden's, with the flush of returning heat coming to his cheeks like a sinner's blush. His cuffs were wet; he held them out to the fire, and I saw the thin wool of them, dyed with some bright foreign dye such as we don't see much hereabouts. Unfortunately, the dye had run onto the white cuffs of his shirt. Under one of them the glint of a gold band showed; he saw me looking, but made no great shift to hide it. His hands were very harpers' hands, long and supple and smooth.<br><br>Meg handed him the welcome cup, saying, "I'm Meg, and this is my goodman, Gavin, son of Coll Blacksides." We hold by the old laws in these parts, so it was right that he know the names of his hosts, and be under no weird to give his own, but only to accept our hospitality if it went not against his honor or his kin's.<br><br>The harper shuddered as though shaking the last of the bone-chill out of him, and drank deep of Meg's posset. "Never king was better feasted," he told her. Meg doesn't hold with nonsense, and she dealt him the look she keeps for troublesome bairns, or chickens that stray from the yard. He coughed, smiled sweetly at her, coughed again to clear his throat, said even sweeter, "Ah, mistress, you think I flatter! And, indeed, what call have you to take the word of a poor traveler with more mud on him than he left on the road, and a face to frighten the very bogles in the glen? Is this a man, you say, to come before the king's highness? But, I beg you, picture me washed and combed, dry-shod and clad, a song on my lips and a harp in my hand. And so have I harped before the very king at Roxburgh. He was feasting at the time, and I have gazed with pleasure at the dishes set on his table." He nodded with a grave air. "Aye; seen, but not tasted, for harpers are to kings as our friend there is to you"--nodding at Tray, who dozed fitfully at my feet, uneasy with the stranger. "Oh, I have watched our good king feast on the white bread and the marrow--and, like you, he sometimes throws his crumbs to the dogs." And making only to scratch his head, he raised his arm so that his sleeve fell back to show us the gold bracelet.<br><br>Well, it was a fool's trick, if you ask me, risking much to show off: how was he to know we'd not murder him for the gold? It made me wonder how long the minstrel had been on the road, not to think of that.<br><br>Still, I was curious to hear more: I'm not much traveled myself, but I always like news of the world, and a good tale is welcome everywhere. We don't get many passing through hereabouts, save the odd friar.<br><br>It's not that we hadn't seen harpers before. There's one usually stops at the fair, and Laverock Hugh had one resting at his place once. But none like this. I wondered if he really did know the king, and if he'd harp for us.<br><br>"Sir," I began.<br><br>But he held up one of his hands, very pretty, like he was halting a procession. "Goodman," he says, "I am not deserving of that title, nor of any. I am but a plain man, whom it has pleased God to grant some gift of music and verse, and to find favor with the princes of the earth."<br><br>Now, I'm not the sort to find fault in myself just because others do; but for all his fine words, an older man would have put that better, so I didn't feel wrong about it. Oh, he was quick and clever enough. Still, there's plenty of room for everyone in this world.<br><br>I didn't say anything, and Meg clattered loud at the hearth, turning the cakes. The minstrel looks from one to the other of us, and then his face brightens like some young dogs I've known, that think to turn your mind from the mess they've made with fetching of the ball.<br><br>"Now, surely, friends," he says, "you've heard the tale of the Cat Who Spoke Truth to Kings?"<br><br>"No," says Meg. "We have not." I could tell she wished to hear it, but my Meg is a woman of sense. "And have you heard," she says to him, "the tale of the lad who talked so much his tongue fell off?"<br><br>The wanderer laughed, breaking to cough. "I have not," he says hoarsely. "I pray you, tell it me, for I am always looking for strange, unlikely tales to amuse folk with on my travels."<br><br>I held my breath, waiting for Meg to give him his come-uppance. Even as a lass she'd never let folk get the better of her. The corners of her mouth quirked down, then up. She laughed a real laugh, not a tight one like his.<br><br>And, "I'm sure," she says, "you know many a fine tale. And we'll be pleased to hear them--when you've gotten out of those wet clothes and had a bit to sup. You'll take Gavin's cloak that's dry, for now, and lie next the fire this night."<br><br>He opened his hands, empty. "You understand--I have nothing to give you."<br><br>"Tch!" Meg went from sweet to sharp in a flash. "Young man, do you think this house is Michaelmas Fair? There's no trading going on here. Now, you've had a hard journey, so you'll drink up your posset now and lie down nice by the fire. And when your own clothes are dry tomorrow you'll have them back, and then if you like you can press on to wherever it is you're in such a hurry to get to."<br><br>"You're very kind." There was a sort of surprise in his voice. The minstrel coughed. Then he stood up, like in some lord's hall. My old cloak hung only to his knees, and sat his well-made shoulders better than it ever did on me.</p><h2>Twist and Go Scooters: 50 to 250 cc with Carburetor Engines</h2><p><p>With a Haynes manual, you can do it yourself...from simple maintenance to basic repairs.

Rokossovsky: The Red Army&#39;s Gentleman Commander</h2><p>The author Boris Sokolov offers this first objective and intriguing biography of Marshal Konstantin Konstantinovich Rokossovsky, who is widely considered one of the Red Army's top commanders in the Second World War. Yet even though he brilliantly served the harsh Stalinist system, Rokossovsky himself became a victim of it with his arrest, beatings and imprisonment between 1937 and 1940. <br><br>The author analyzes all of Rokossovsky's military operations, in both the Russian Civil War and the Second World War, paying particular attention to the problem of establishing the real casualties suffered by both armies in the main battles where Rokossovsky took part, as well as on the Eastern Front as a whole. Rokossovsky played a prominent role in the battles for Smolensk, Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, Belorussia, Poland, East Prussia and Pomerania. While praising Rokossovsky's masterful generalship, the author does not shy away from criticizing the nature of Soviet military art and strategy, in which the guiding principle was "at all costs" and little value was placed on holding down casualties. This discussion extends to the painful topic of the many atrocities against civilians perpetrated by Soviet soldiers, including Rokossovsky's own troops. <br><br>A highly private man, Rokossovsky disliked discussing his personal life. With the help of family records and interviews, including the original, uncensored draft of the Marshal's memoirs, the author reveals the numerous dualities in Rokossovsky's life. Despite his imprisonment and beatings he endured, Rokossovsky never wavered in his loyalty to Stalin, yet also never betrayed his colleagues. Though a Stalinist, he was also a gentleman widely admired for his courtesy and chivalry. A dedicated family man, women were drawn to him, and he took a 'campaign wife' during the war. Though born in 1894 in Poland, Rokossovsky maintained that he was really born in Russia in 1896. This Polish/Russian duality in Rokossovsky's identity hampered his career and became particularly acute during the Warsaw uprising in 1944 and his later service as Poland's Defense Minister. Thus, the author ably portrays a fascinating man and commander, who became a marshal of two countries, yet who was not fully embraced by either.</p><p>Dr. Boris Sokolov is a prolific author and a member of PEN International, which celebrates literature and promotes freedom of expression.

Stuart Britton once again has provided an excellent translation from the original Russian and Helion, the publisher, has produced a book of the highest quality. Sokolov deserves high praise for his work and the attention that he has brought to a little known but superb Russian Commander. His writing style is quite different from traditional Western authors as it reverts periodically to an almost spoken text; however this only requires getting used to and does not take away from the quality of the research. He also provides a selected bibliography, unfortunately for the Western reader it primarily refers to Russian sources.

Now his three most breathtaking chronicles are available in trade paperback for the very first time, certain to delight Jordan and Conan fans everywhere.</p><p>In<i> Conan the Magnificent</i>, our hero is stalked amid the savage crags of the Kezankian Mountains, caught between rival armies as the sultry huntress Jondra closes in. In <i>Conan the Triumphant</i>, he enters the service of the sumptuous Lady Synelle, unaware that she is the secret high priestess of the demon god Al'Kirr. In the third chronicle, Conan faces his most terrifying adversary yet -- the Sinani, demon-guardians of the ancient tomb of the Vendhyan kings. He must first seek out an antidote to the unknown poison coursing through his veins, then resist the charms of the voluptuous noblewoman Vyndra if he is to be . . . <i>Conan the Victorious</i>.</p></p><p>Long before Robert Jordan built his wildly successful Wheel of Time series (debuting with 1990's <i>Eye of the World</i>), the now-canonized writer cut his fantasy teeth borrowing time with Robert E. Howard's dark pulp-fiction hero, Conan of Cimmeria. Of the six novels Jordan contributed to the Conan series (well, seven, if you count the alt-history <i>Conan the Destroyer</i>), three have been assembled here for rerelease: 1983's <i>Conan the Triumphant</i> and 1984's <i>Conan the Magnificent</i> and <i>Conan the Victorious</i>. (The other three appear in Jordan's first collection, <i>The Conan Chronicles</i>.)<p> Anyone who writes Conan stories immediately draws the scrutiny of true believers--those of us who carted around tattered Carter and de Camp paperbacks in our book bags for years, drooling over the lusty Boris Vallejo covers (laughably tame compared to the <i>Weird Tales</i> covers from the '20s and '30s, where Conan first appeared). But Jordan gets it right, some argue better than anyone but REH himself, soundly grasping the first rule of Conan writing: the stories aren't <i>about</i> Conan; Conan <i>is</i> the story. A problematic hero, an almost elemental force, Conan exists beyond good and evil--the predictable wench-hoisting and head-cleaving of a good Conan tale are just a backdrop for the blue-eyed barbarian, which plays perfectly to Jordan's superlative descriptive skills.</p><p> This second Jordan collection is classic Conan: <i>The Magnificent</i> pits the Cimmerian against belligerent hill people, a golden-eyed fire beast, and bow-toting noble babe Jondra; in <i>The Triumphant</i>, Conan kicks butt on the evil god Al'Kiir and his sinister (and, of course, hot) servant Lady Synelle; <i>The Victorious</i>has Conan wounded by a poisoned assassin's blade--and his search for an antidote leads him to Vendhya and a subterranean crypt guarded by the eight-armed beast Masrok and a host of demons.

In the twentieth century, however, he came to be regarded as one of the greatest English poets and painters, one whose insights have profoundly influenced such thinkers as Nietzsche, Freud, and D. H. Lawrence.<br>In this volume, a leading Blake scholar shows how the political and social events and movements of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries influenced or inspired many of Blake's finest poems: "America," "Europe," "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," "The French Revolution," "Songs of Innocence and of Experience," "The Four Zoas," and numerous others. While Blake's poems can be read on many levels, this in-depth critical study demonstrates that much of the strange symbolism of this poetry represents a literary campaign against the political tyranny of the day.<br>For the third edition, David Erdman added much new material that came to light after the original publication of the book in 1954. Also included are over 30 illustrations, a Chronology, an Appendix of Additions and Revisions, and other materials. Written for students, scholars, and Blake specialists &#x2014; anyone interested in the relationship of the poet's extraordinary symbolism and complex thought to the history of his own times &#x2014; Erdman's meticulously documented study is the definitive treatment of this aspect of Blake's work and is unlikely to be superseded.<br>"For our sense of Blake in his own times we are indebted to David Erdman more than anyone else." &#x2014; <i>Times Literary Supplement.<br></i>Dover (1991) republication of the third (1977) edition of <i>Blake: Prophet Against Empire: A Poet's Interpretation of the History of His Own Times, </i>Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1954.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>The History of the Councils of the Church: Volume I, Book 2: The First Ecumenical Council of Nicea</h2><p>The First Council of Nicea was the first Ecumenical Council of the Catholic Church, held in 325 on the occasion of the heresy of Arius (Arianism). As early as 320 or 321 St. Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, convoked a council at Alexandria at which more than one hundred bishops from Egypt and Libya anathematized Arius. The latter continued to officiate in his church and to recruit followers. Being finally driven out, he went to Palestine and from there to Nicomedia. During this time St. Alexander published his &#34;Epistola encyclica&#34;, to which Arius replied; but henceforth it was evident that the quarrel had gone beyond the possibility of human control. Sozomen even speaks of a Council of Bithynia which addressed an encyclical to all the bishops asking them to receive the Arians into the communion of the Church. This discord, and the war which soon broke out between Constantine and Licinius, added to the disorder and partly explains the progress of the religious conflict during the years 322-3. Finally Constantine, having conquered Licinius and become sole emperor, concerned himself with the re-establishment of religious peace as well as of civil order. He addressed letters to St. Alexander and to Arius deprecating these heated controversies regarding questions of no practical importance, and advising the adversaries to agree without delay. It was evident that the emperor did not then grasp the significance of the Arian controversy. Hosius of Cordova, his counsellor in religious matters, bore the imperial letter to Alexandria, but failed in his conciliatory mission. Seeing this, the emperor, perhaps advised by Hosius, judged no remedy more apt to restore peace in the Church than the convocation of an ecumenical council.</p><p></p><h2>Montparnasse: Paris&#39;s District of Memory and Desire (Great Parisian Neighborhoods)</h2><p><p>In the third portrait of his series Great Parisian Neighborhoods, award-winning raconteur John Baxter takes readers on a dazzling excursion of Montparnasse.</p><p>By the IACP Award-winning author of the national bestseller <em>The Most Beautiful Walk in the World</em>, MONTPARNASSE reveals the history and present delights of the iconic neighborhood that is best associated with the vibrant 1920-30s-era Paris&#x2014;a romantic time and place evoked in Hemingway's memoir <em>A Moveable Feast</em> and Henry Miller's <em>Tropic of Cancer</em>.

Allie would rather live a hand-to-mouth existence than accept the family fortune&#x2014;and the strings that come with it. But when she finds a boy dying from a magical Offload that has her father&#x2019;s signature all over it, Allie is thrown back into his world of black magic.

In this clever and compulsively readable debut, set in a magical analog of Portland, Ore., Allie Beckstrom is a Hound, able to trace a spell back to its caster. When a young boy is injured by a spell, Allie tracks it back to her estranged father, Daniel, a ruthless businessman who protests his innocence. Then someone magically disguised as Allie kills Daniel. Allie and sexy corporate operative Zayvion race against time to find the answers. Magic is common in this alternate universe, but using it always incurs a physical or mental cost, rendering it a commodity to be bought and sold, used and abused. Allie's internal and external struggles are brilliantly and tightly written, creating a multifaceted character who will surprise, amuse, amaze and absorb readers. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Yet these books don&#x2019;t just tell readers what to eat: they offer complete philosophies about who Americans are and how we should live.&nbsp;<i>Diet and the Disease of Civilization</i>&nbsp;interrupts the predictable debate about eating right to ask a hard question: what if it&#x2019;s not calories&#x2014;but concepts&#x2014;that should be counted?</p><p>Cultural critic Adrienne Rose Bitar reveals how four popular diets retell the &#x201c;Fall of Man&#x201d; as the narrative backbone for our national consciousness.

Henry Award-winner John Biguenet earned wide acclaim for his debut short-story collection, The Torturer's Apprentice. In his astonishing first novel, Oyster, he demonstrates the same mastery of craft and rigor of vision that led critics across the country to join Robert Olen Butler in praising this "important new writer." </p> <p> Set on the Louisiana coast in 1957, <i>Oyster</i> recounts the engrossing tale of a deadly rivalry between two families. To avoid ruin after years of declining oyster crops, Felix and Mathilde Petitjean offer their young daughter, Therese, in marriage to 52-year-old Horse Bruneau, who holds the papers on their boat and house. Bruneau has spent his life as Felix's rival for both the Petitjeans' century-old oyster beds and, as we learn, Mathilde. But as Therese explains to Horse one night as they float in a pirogue alone in the marsh, "I don't get bought for the price of no damn boat." </p> <p> The spiraling violence of <i>Oyster</i> and the seething passions behind it drive an unpredictable tale of murder and revenge in which two women and the men who desire them play out a drama as elemental and inexorable as a Greek tragedy. </p></p><p><p>John Biguenet's fiction has appeared in such publications as <em>Esquire, Granta, Playboy, Story,</em> and <em>Zoetrope.</em> The winner of an 0. Henry Award for short fiction, he lives in New Orleans. Ecco published his debut collection of stories, <em>The Torturer's Apprentice,</em> in 2001. <em>Oyster</em> is his first novel.</p>Much feted for his debut collection of stories, The Torturer's Apprentice, Biguenet follows up with a steamy first novel set on the Louisiana coast. The Petitjeans and the Bruneaus are rival oyster fishing families in Plaquemines Parish in 1957, struggling to survive in an environment rapidly falling prey to petroleum companies and their ravaging of swamp and bayou ecosystems. As it gets more difficult to hang on economically, old families begin to slip. The Petitjean family, headed by Felix, has reluctantly turned to "Horse" Bruneau for a loan. Desperate for cash, Felix and his wife, Mathilde, approve Horse's plan to marry their daughter, Therese. Therese scotches that plan by luring Horse to the Petitjean property for a supposed midnight tryst, then murdering him. When Horse's body turns up in a trawler's net, his sons Darryl ("Little Horse") and Ross (with their gentler brother, Rusty, looking on in horror) murder Therese's brother, Alton, who they blame for Horse's murder since nobody even considers that a slip of a girl like Therese could kill the powerful Horse. Darryl has always hated Alton, anyway, suspecting (rightly, as it turns out) that Alton is his half brother the fruit of an affair between Mathilde and Horse. After the murder, Sheriff Christovich, an old beau of Mathilde's, manipulates Darryl into letting Rusty work for the Petitjeans, hoping Rusty will talk. But it is Therese who exacts vengeance on the Bruneau house with the implacability of a Plaquemines Lady Macbeth. While Biguenet makes the Bruneaus, except for Rusty, a bit too villainous and Therese a bit too clever for plausibility's sake, his debut satisfyingly penetrates the curtain of gumbo clich surrounding Cajun culture.

Read about her forthcoming publications at MonaRaeMiracle.comOne can hardly blame the cynical reader for eying a new biography of Marilyn Monroe and thinking, "Right, I'm sure there are some things we don't know about <i>her</i>." In fact, this biography, written by Monroe's half-sister, Berniece Baker Miracle, and Miracle's daughter, isn't really a biography of Marilyn Monroe at all. No, it's a biography of Norma Jeane Baker, and there turns out to be plenty we don't know about <i>her</i>. Berniece and Norma Jeane were half-sisters, born seven years apart to their mother, Gladys, who eventually would be diagnosed as schizophrenic. At her father's insistence, Berniece lived with him from age four; Gladys' mental breakdown necessitated Norma Jeane's stay with several foster families. The girls did not learn of each other until Berniece was 19 and Norma Jeane 12. But once each did discover the existence of the other, they stayed in close contact--both before and after Norma Jeane became MM--writing letters (many of which are reproduced here), visiting, and just being family. Without disclosing a lot of dirty laundry, this is a deeply intimate book, one that makes Monroe come alive more fully than the earlier tell-alls that focused on her acting career. Both through her own letters, and in her sister's reminiscences, Monroe emerges not merely as a troubled star but as a woman concerned throughout her life with family, a warm and vulnerable woman eager to maintain a relationship with those who care about her.

We see into the minds and hearts of Soviet citizens who recorded their lives during an extraordinary period of revolutionary fervor and state terror. Writing a diary, like other creative expression, seems nearly impossible amid the fear and distrust of totalitarian rule; but as Jochen Hellbeck shows, diary-keeping was widespread, as individuals struggled to adjust to Stalin's regime.</p><p>Rather than protect themselves against totalitarianism, many men and women bent their will to its demands, by striving to merge their individual identities with the collective and by battling vestiges of the old self within. We see how Stalin's subjects, from artists to intellectuals and from students to housewives, absorbed directives while endeavoring to fulfill the mandate of the Soviet revolution--re-creation of the self as a builder of the socialist society. Thanks to a newly discovered trove of diaries, we are brought face to face with individual life stories--gripping and unforgettably poignant. </p><p>The diarists' efforts defy our liberal imaginations and our ideals of autonomy and private fulfillment. These Soviet citizens dreamed differently. They coveted a morally and aesthetically superior form of life, and were eager to inscribe themselves into the unfolding revolution. <i>Revolution on My Mind</i> is a brilliant exploration of the forging of the revolutionary self, a study without precedent that speaks to the evolution of the individual in mass movements of our own time.</p></p><p>Jochen Hellbeck is Associate Professor of History at Rutgers University.&#x201c;One of the most important books ever written in the field of Soviet Studies, <i> Revolution on My Mind</i> is a brilliantly conceived, poignant work about the experience of trying to live as a self-conscious Soviet citizen. Beautifully written and analytically compelling, this is a book for anyone who has thought deeply or cared passionately, one way or the other, about Communism and its impact on individual lives.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Eric Naiman, University of California at Berkeley</b><br><br>&#x201c;This masterful book looks at the Russian Revolution from an entirely new perspective. It explores how individuals refashioned their personal selves to bring their lives into alignment with the revolution. Far from being oppressed by history, Soviet diarists embraced it; they became the engineers of their own souls. Hellbeck has provocatively rewritten the emotional history of twentieth-century Communism.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peter Fritzsche, author of <i>Stranded in the Present: Modern Time and the Melancholy of History</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hellbeck's work is pathbreaking in the challenges it poses to our past thinking about Soviet history. Using previously unknown diaries of the Stalin era, he explores the fascinating worlds of Soviet subjectivity. This book is hard to put down!&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark L. von Hagen, Columbia University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Historian Hellbeck found a cache of diaries in newly opened Soviet archives that overturns easy assumptions about the inner lives of people subjected to totalitarian rule...Their eloquent, self-critical, and affecting diaries reveal how seriously they took the government's exhortations not merely to conform outwardly to communist precepts but also to fully internalize them. Each believed that self-improvement, sacrifice, reeducation, and endurance were intrinsic to the success of the revolution. Loneliness, fear, and an ever-widening divide between ideology and reality made life increasingly harrowing for these determined, sometimes ruthless citizens, and their trust and conviction make Stalin's terror all the more heinous.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Donna Seaman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hellbeck draws on a cache of Stalin-era diaries found through friends in Russia to paint a dark portrait of how ordinary people bent their individual wills to what they believed was a greater good.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>A. Craig Copetas</b><b>, </b><b><i>Bloomberg News</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;How do tyrants succeed? Their monstrous ability to secure absolute power over a nation can't be based solely on fear. Ambition and some sort of twisted idealism or romanticism must also be involved. Historian Jochen Hellbeck found striking explanations for this mystery in an astonishing cache of Soviet diaries that radically challenge our notions about totalitarian rule...The humanity expressed in these diaries makes the crimes of Stalin and his followers all the more heinous...[Hellbeck's] thinking is cogent, his command of Russian history fluent, his deductions galvanizing, and his fascination with and empathy for the people he portrays compelling and thought-provoking.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Donna Seaman</b><b>, </b><b><i>Speakeasy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[A] fascinating book...Hellbeck's analysis of his diarists is first-rate, and his enthusiasm for his subject is infectious...This book helps us to understand a particular Soviet mindset of the 1930s...It suggests an intriguing way of understanding the over-the-top enthusiasm that the Soviet regime inspired among some of its citizens in the 1930s.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sheila Fitzpatrick</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The principal service of Jochen Hellbeck's <i>Revolution on My Mind</i> is that it transports us back to that earlier, impassioned revolutionary Soviet Union, a time of epic hope and energy, when the transformation of man and history seemed imminent...Insightful and intelligent...He delivers much that is fresh and useful...This book takes the reader back to those nearly unimaginable times.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Richard Lourie</b><b>, </b><b><i>Moscow Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Hellbeck's attempt to situate the Bolshevik project of self-transformation within this wider cultural and historical perspective (a dimension too often lacking in Western studies of the Soviet era) is one of the outstanding virtues of his impressive book. Never overburdening his narrative with theorizing, his sensitive and sympathetic approach allows his subjects to speak for themselves, expressing sometimes a repulsive indifference to the fate of Stalin's victims, sometimes a tragic struggle to rationalize the destruction of friends or family accused of ludicrous crimes...His study adds an important dimension to the work done by other scholars to throw light on the psychological reasons behind the collusion of moral idealists in the extreme violence of the Stalin years...One can hope that Hellbeck will follow the present fine study with a sequel.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Aileen Kelly</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The study consists of texts and analysis of diaries written during Stalin's rule in the time of collectivization, purges, and labor camps.

For the first time the brothers of the Society of Saint John the Evangelist are making their rule? completely rewritten and revised? available to the church at large. <br><br>The book is composed of 49 short chapters that develop classical monastic themes of hospitality, poverty, celibacy, and obedience, exploring what these might mean to men and women living at the end of the millennium. And because this is a modern rule, it provides guidance and reflection in less traditional areas, too? leadership, conflict, the use and abuse of authority, work, the need for rest and silence, vocation, and fellowship with the poor. Therefore it has much to teach Christians in other kinds of communities, including the family, the parish, and the workplace. <br><br>Concluding chapters give suggestions for meditating on the Rule and for its use as an aid to discernment and spiritual growth for prayer groups and parish life committees.</p><p>After eight years of collective effort, the SSJE produced a comprehensive document, solidly scripturally-based, that sets out a bold definition of their current lifestyle. Their Rule is both profound and forthright. . . . Part of the impressive nature of this Rule is the care with which it is crafted and presented. Each sentence carries weight, as the end product of much careful labor and thinking. . . . [The] remarkable concluding section . . . offers six pages of guidance for Christians outside the monastic tradition who may wish to use the Rule in their own personal reflection on the Christian life. . . .

After serving as a US Marine during World War II and attending college on the GI Bill, Sam Keith decided to seek adventure and acceptance in Alaska. He arrived on Kodiak Island in July, 1952, where he secured a job as a laborer on the Adak Navy base. He befriended a group of like-minded men there, including Dick Proenneke, who shared a love of the outdoors, hard work, and self-reliance. Keith explored the wilds of South Central Alaska while working on the Navy base, and later as a Stream Guard and Enforcement Patrolman. In his hunting and fishing trips with Dick and his friends, Keith found almost everything he sought. But at the end of three years, Keith decided to go Outside to pursue other dreams. Dick Proenneke tells him, &#x201c;Sam, you know right well you don&#x2019;t want to leave this country. Don&#x2019;t give up on it. Me and you got to figure something out.&#x201d; In 1973, Keith went on to write ONE MAN'S WILDERNESS: AN ALASKAN ODYSSEY, based on his dear friend&#x2019;s journals and photography. It was reissued in 1999 and won a National Outdoor Book Award (NOBA). In 2003, portions of text from the book and some of Proenneke's 16mm movies were used in Alone in the Wilderness, which began appearing on US public television stations. The documentary follows Proenneke as he builds a log cabin with only hand tools, and includes reflections on wildlife, weather, and the natural scenery he sees around him. Sam Keith passed away in 2003. But in 2013, his son-in-law, children&#x2019;s book author/illustrator Brian Lies, discovered in an archive box in their garage a book manuscript, originally written in 1974 after the publication of ONE MAN&#x2019;S WILDERNESS. FIRST WILDERNESS is the story of Keith&#x2019;s own experiences, at times harrowing, funny, and fascinating. Along with the original manuscript are photos and excerpts from his journals, letters, and notebooks, woven in to create a compelling and poignant memoir of search and discovery.

Juniper Song is back in a thrilling story about heritage and responsibility, motherhood and genocide.</b></p><p>Finally a licensed private detective, Steph Cha's "compelling and original" (LA Times) crime heroine Juniper Song is managing her own cases as the junior investigator of Lindley &amp; Flores. When a woman named Rubina Gasparian approaches Song, she knows she's in for her most unusual case yet. Rubin and her husband Van-both Armenian-American doctors-cannot get pregnant, so Rubina's younger cousin, Lusig, is acting as their surrogate. However, Lusig's best friend Nora has been missing for a month, and Rubina is concerned that her nearly eight-month-pregnant cousin is dealing with her stress in a way that could harm the baby. Rubina hires Song to shadow her and report all that she finds. Of course, Lusig is frantically searching for Nora, and Song's case soon turns into a hunt for the missing woman, an activist embroiled in an ugly, public battle over the erection of an Armenian genocide memorial. As Song probes the depths of both the tight-knit Armenian-American community and the groups who antagonize it, she realizes that Nora was surrounded on all sides by danger. But can she find out what happened before it's too late for Nora or Rubina and Van's child-or for Song herself?</p><p> A gorgeously written, tightly plotted, and emotionally charged read, <i>Dead Soon Enough</i> is an unforgettable story of what we will do for the things we believe in, and the people we love, perfect for fans of Lisa Unger and Tana French.</p></p><p>STEPH CHA is the author of <i>Follow Her Home</i> and <i>Beware Beware</i>.

In adrenalin-fueled prose, Juniper solves the latent mystery behind Tilley's demise, but closure leaves a bitter taste in her mouth. In the process, she becomes much darker, more reflective, more cynical and ruthless.

Cha does a great job of keeping the suspense taut, with deft pacing and effective cliff-hangers. Action pushes the plot resolutely forward -- whether Juniper is getting knocked out in the middle of the night or finding her bed chillingly made by someone other than herself. And Juniper herself is a likeable character with a distinct voice.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Hyphen Magazine on Follow Her Home</i></p><p>&#x201c;Follow Her Home is a brilliant, modern twist to the classic noir genre; full of clever prose that invites and excites the reader's attention.

That's how Entertainment Weekly described Steve Allen's enormous contribution to American popular culture in a tribute to the legendary entertainer after his death on October 30, 2000. Steve Allen created the Tonight show &#x2015; America's longest running entertainment show and most successful late-night TV show. In so doing he led the way for other American icons: Johnny Carson, Jack Paar, David Letterman, and Jay Leno. The formula we all now take for granted did not exist before Allen: the desk, the opening monologue, breezy chats with celebrities, wacky stunts, comedy sketches, cameras roaming down the hall and outside the theater, off-the-cuff interviews with passers-by, and ad-lib banter with the studio audience. It's all great fun and it's all due to the incredibly witty, incurably silly, musically gifted, and ever-likeable Steve Allen.Based on exclusive interviews, Ben Alba has produced this wonderful history of the first Tonight show, complete with terrific photos from the show and revealing insights from over 30 entertainment legends who knew and worked with Steve Allen &#x2015; including Sid Caesar, Carl Reiner, Jonathan Winters, Don Knotts, Louis Nye, Tom Poston, Bill Dana, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, Andy Williams, Tim Conway, the Smothers Brothers, Diahann Carroll, Eartha Kitt, Bill Dana, and Doc Severinsen. In addition, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Bill Maher, Bob Costas, and other TV veterans reflect on Allen's contributions.Starting with Allen's early career in radio, Alba shows how the young radio talent developed many of the elements that would soon light up late-night television. He then highlights Allen's many innovations that made the Tonight show so appealing and enduring: the single-guest and single theme shows, road shows and live segments from across the country, Broadway shows visiting Tonight, creating a forum for jazz artistry and a groundbreaking showcase for African-American talent, musical tributes, and the use of the studio audience as a comedy goldmine.Alba has created an invaluable, entertaining, and revealing behind-the-scenes look at the birth of an American television institution and its brilliant inventor, whose influence continues to make America stay awake and laugh &#x2015;night after night.</p><p>Ben Alba (Chicago, IL) is an author, a trial lawyer, a law professor, a musician, and a classic television buff. He teaches legal writing and codirects the bar passage program at DePaul University College of Law. Previously, he was a litigation attorney for the Chicago law firm of William J. Sneckenberg &amp; Associates (now Sneckenberg, Thompson &amp; Brody).Lest anyone think that late-night TV's zany characters and stunts began with Johnny, Jay or Dave, this love letter to original Tonight host Steve Allen will set them straight. Alba's portrait depicts Allen as a ground-breaking force in television whose brief stint (1954-57) on NBC's late-night show had a lasting influence on late night TV. Allen comes across as both a regular Joe and a multitalented Renaissance man whose knack for ad-libbing with audiences, loosely scripted gags and improvisational piano-playing in the days of live TV were as nimble as his commitment to progressive social causes. (Imagine Leno or Letterman devoting segments to discussions of drug abuse or organized crime.) Although only a few episodes of the Allen-era Tonight have survived, this book commendably captures the show's flavor in front of the camera and behind the scenes. That's largely thanks to interviews with Allen prior to his 2000 death and his numerous cohorts and admirers: Tonight producer Bill Harbach; regulars Steve Lawrence and Andy Williams; Don Knotts, Tim Conway and Tom Poston from Allen's prime-time variety series; and longtime friends Sid Caesar and Carl Reiner. Highlights include a blow-by-blow comparison between some of Allen's gags and those later adapted by Johnny Carson and others. The book would benefit from better structuring, and more than a few quotes are repetitious, continually praising Allen's wit and innovation without adding any fresh examples. Like Allen, whose sharp wit and genial demeanor appealed to a wide audience, Alba's detailed homage should resonate with a wide array of readers. 32 pages of b&amp;w photos.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(He has had to be articulate: in the 1960s and 1970s, most of the classical-music establishment was contemptuous of, if not downright hostile to, his ideas.) <i>The Musical Dialogue</i>, along with Harnoncourt's <i>Baroque Music Today: Music as Speech</i> (to which this volume was issued as a companion), is a valuable collection of lectures and essays laying out those ideas. In the previous book, Harnoncourt discussed his views on phrasing (using short phrases based on the idea of rhetoric rather than on a long, unbroken legato line) and the use of period instruments (not simply because the composer used them, but because, when played well, they reveal more of the music to our ears now). <p> In <i>The Musical Dialogue</i>, Harnoncourt gets specific: he discusses how Monteverdi, Bach, and Mozart used particular instruments and forms and talks about his own experience analyzing and performing particular works. Among the topics he treats are the various possibilities for instrumentation in Monteverdi's works (and why there are so many), how he figured out what exactly was the <i>oboe da caccia</i> ("hunting oboe") called for in some of Bach's vocal works, and the performance history of the <i>St. Matthew Passion</i> and the Mass in B Minor and how that history has affected audience reactions to modern-day period-instrument performances of the works. </p><p> Perhaps most valuable are Harnoncourt's discussions of Mozart: for example, how the meaning of tempo markings such as "allegro" and "andante" has changed from the 18th century to today, as well as the many and varied conventions of phrasing that were widely understood--and therefore were not written out in Mozart's scores and performing parts. One caveat: these essays were written in the 1970s and 1980s, and there are a few cases where subsequent events have overtaken Harnoncourt's observations. For example, Monteverdi's large-scale works were probably not orchestrated quite as freely as he indicates; there are now a number of mixed adult choirs that can reproduce fairly well the pure tone of boys' choirs (which was not true in the 1960s and 1970s); and present-day composers and audiences are no longer completely alienated from each other, especially in the United States. Nevertheless, the observations of this important, influential, and idiosyncratic maestro make fascinating reading. <i>--Matthew Westphal</i></p>Nikolaus Harnoncourt founded the ensemble for early music, <i>Concentus Musicus </i> in 1953. Harnoncourt teaches at the Mozarteum and the Institute of Musicology in Salzburg and has conducted and performed at the Salzburg Festival.</p><h2>The Monkey&#39;s Raincoat (An Elvis Cole and Joe Pike Novel, 1)</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;Elvis Cole provides more fun for the reader than any L.A. private eye to come along in years.&#x201d;&#x2014;Joseph Wambaugh</b></p><p><b>WINNER OF THE ANTHONY AND MACAVITY AWARDS FOR BEST NOVEL � NOMINATED FOR THE EDGAR AND SHAMUS AWARDS FOR BEST NOVEL</b></p><p>Meet Elvis Cole, L.A. private eye . . . </p><p>He quotes Jiminy Cricket and carries a .38.

He is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including The Two Minute Rule, The Forgotten Man, and L.A. Requiem.With smooth efficiency, David Stuart reads this abridgment of Robert Crais's first novel, the Anthony and Macavity Award-winning mystery that introduced Private Investigator Elvis Cole. Stuart reads with a syncopated hesitation that confers a Hollywood sullenness but misses the "noir" edge of Crais's writing. Elvis Cole--the sensitive and wisecracking collector of Disneyana--and his heavy-artillery partner, Joe Pike, traipse through the seamier streets of Los Angeles, infiltrate high-society Hollywood, and cross the line with the Latino drug trade in search of an errant husband and a missing boy. The adventure and the characters of this novel are exciting and totally satisfying.

Buford. As Buford, she single-handedly organized an Arkansas regiment; participated in the historic battles of Bull Run, Balls Bluff, Fort Donelson, and Shiloh; romanced men and women; and eventually decided that spying as a woman better suited her Confederate cause than fighting as a man. In the North, she posed as a double agent and worked to traffic information, drugs, and counterfeit bills to support the Confederate cause. She was even hired by the Yankee secret service to find "the woman . . . traveling and figuring as a Confederate agent"&#x2014;Velazquez herself.<br><br>Originally published in 1876 as <i>The Woman in Battle</i>, this Civil War narrative offers Velazquez&#x2019;s seemingly impossible autobiographical account, as well as a new critical introduction and glossary by Jesse Alem�n. Scholars are divided between those who read the book as a generally honest autobiography and those who read it as mostly fiction. According to Alem�n&#x2019;s critical introduction, the book also reads as pulp fiction, spy memoir, seduction narrative, travel literature, and historical account, while it mirrors the literary conventions of other first-person female accounts of cross-dressing published in the United States during wartime, dating back to the Revolutionary War. Whatever the facts are, this is an authentic Civil War narrative, Alem�n concludes, that recounts how war disrupts normal gender roles, redefines national borders, and challenges the definition of identity.<br></p><p>Wisconsin Studies in Autobiography William L.

It is in actuality a collection of sagas concerning the various rulers of Norway, from about A.D. 850 to the year A.D. 1177. While scholars and historians continue to debate the historical accuracy of Sturluson&#39;s work, the &#34;Heimskringla&#34; is still considered an important original source for information on the Viking Age, a period which Sturluson covers almost in its entirety. Contained within this work are the following individual sagas: Halfdan the Black Saga, Harald Harfager&#39;s Saga, Hakon the Good&#39;s Saga, Saga of King Harald Grafeld and of Earl Hakon Son of Sigurd, King Olaf Trygvason&#39;s Saga, Saga of Olaf Haraldson (St. Olaf), Saga of Magnus the Good, Saga of Harald Hardrade, Saga of Olaf Kyrre, Magnus Barefoot&#39;s Saga, Saga of Sigurd the Crusader and His Brothers Eystein and Olaf, Saga of Magnus the Blind and of Harald Gille, Saga of Sigurd, Inge, and Eystein, the Sons of Harald, Saga of Hakon Herdebreid (&#34;Hakon the Broad-Shouldered&#34;), and Magnus Erlingson&#39;s Saga.</p><p></p><h2>A Theory of the Firm: Governance, Residual Claims, and Organizational Forms</h2><p><p>This collection examines the forces, both external and internal, that lead corporations to behave efficiently and to create wealth. Corporations vest control rights in shareholders, the author argues, because they are the constituency that bear business risk and therefore have the appropriate incentives to maximize corporate value. Assigning control to any other group would be tantamount to allowing that group to play poker with someone else's money, and would create inefficiencies. The implicit denial of this proposition is the fallacy of the so-called stakeholder theory of the corporation, which argues that corporations should be run in the interests of all stakeholders. This theory offers no account of how conflicts between different stakeholders are to be resolved, and gives managers no principle on which to base decisions, except to follow their own preferences.</p><p>In practice, shareholders delegate their control rights to a board of directors, who hire, fire, and set the compensation of the chief officers of the firm. However, because agents have different incentives than the principals they represent, they can destroy corporate value unless closely monitored. This happened in the 1960s and led to hostile takeovers in the market for corporate control in the 1970s and 1980s. The author argues that the takeover movement generated increases in corporate efficiency that exceeded $1.5 trillion and helped to lay the foundation for the great economic boom of the 1990s.</p></p><p>Michael C. Jensen is Jesse Isidor Straus Professor of Business Administration, Emeritus, Harvard Business School.<p> The most careful academic research strongly suggests that takeovers--along with leveraged restructurings prompted by the threat of takeover have generated large gains for shareholders and for the economy as a whole. Our estimates indicate that from 1976 to 1994 over 45,000 control transactions occurred-including mergers, tender offers, divestitures, and LBOs, totaling $3.3 trillion (in 1994 dollars). The premiums paid to selling firms and their shareholders in these transactions totaled $959 billion (1994 dollars) (<i>Mergerstat Review</i> 1994). And this estimate includes neither the gains to the buyers in such transactions nor the value of efficiency improvements by companies pressured by control market activity into reforming <i>without</i> a visible control transaction. </p><p> Exit problems appear to be particularly severe in companies that for long periods enjoyed rapid growth, commanding market positions, and high cash flow and profits. In these situations, the culture of the organization and the mindset of managers seem to make it extremely difficult for adjustment to take place until long after the problems have become severe, and in some cases even unsolvable... In industry after industry with excess capacity, managers fail to recognize that they themselves must downsize; instead they leave the exit to others while they continue to invest. When all managers behave this way, exit is significantly delayed at substantial cost of real resources to society. </p><p> With the shutdown of the capital markets as an effective mechanism for motivating change, renewal, and exit, we are left to depend on the internal control system to act to preserve organizational assets, both human and nonhuman. Throughout corporate America, the problems that motivated much of the control activity of the 1980s are now reflected in lackluster performance, financial distress, and pressures for restructuring. Kodak, IBM, Xerox, ITT, and many others have faced or are now facing severe challenges in the product markets. We therefore must understand why these internal control systems have failed and learn how to make them work. </p></p><h2>Motivate Your Child Action Plan</h2><p>Use this step-by-step guide to identify a specific problem and then define a character-based solution.

Inspired in his early poems by troubadour love poetry, Dante would later come to master all the genres of the time, such as the canzone, the sonnet and the ballad. At the same time deeply personal &#x2013; dealing with themes of love, death and exile &#x2013; and imbued with the poetic and political milieux of the period, Dante&#x2019;s Rime offer a fascinating glimpse into the imagination of arguably the greatest writer of all time.</p><p><b>Dante Alighieri</b> (c.1265&#x2013;1321) is the author of <i>The</i> <i>Divine Comedy</i>, a masterpiece of world literature.</p><h2>God as Reason: Essays in Philosophical Theology</h2><p>In <i>God as Reason: Essays in Philosophical Theology</i>, Vittorio H�sle presents a systematic exploration of the relation between theology and philosophy. In examining the problems and historical precursors of rational theology, he calls on philosophy, theology, history of science, and the history of ideas to find an interpretation of Christianity that is compatible with a genuine commitment to reason. The essays in the first part of <i>God as Reason</i> deal with issues of philosophical theology. H�sle sketches the challenges that a rationalist theology must face and discusses some of the central ones, such as the possibility of a teleological interpretation of nature after Darwin, the theodicy issue, freedom versus determinism, the mindbody problem, and the relation in general between religion, theology, and philosophy. In the essays of the second part, H�sle studies the historical development of philosophical approaches to the Bible, the continuity between the New Testament concept of <i>pneuma</i> and the concept of <i>Geist</i> (spirit) in German idealism, and the rationalist theologies of Anselm, Abelard, Llull, and Nicholas of Cusa, whose innovative philosophy of mathematics is the topic of one of the chapters. The book concludes with a thorough evaluation of Charles Taylor&#x2019;s theory of secularization. This ambitious work will interest students and scholars of philosophical theology and philosophy of religion as well as historians of ideas and science.</p><p>Vittorio H�sle&nbsp;is Paul G.

This is truly a book for our postsecular age. It is a text peppered with criticism of our contemporary attitudes in very numerous fields including philosophy, ours being a &#x2018;time in which the essence of philosophy is being undermined by an increasingly narrow specialization,&#x2019; and it stimulates the reader on almost every page. This is not only a major challenge to fideists and fundamentalists of every hue, and a demonstration of the centrality of the quest for rational religion in our not so secular age, but a powerful challenge to the secularists themselves.&#x201d; (Jonathan Israel, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University)<br><br>&#x201c;[H�sle] shows an especially sensitive appreciation for the &#x2018;pragmatics&#x2019; of the exchange between the various parties before turning to consider their arguments.

Given the recent tragic hate-crime shootings, this classic non-fiction book is more relevant than ever. Growing up poor, white and angry on the mean streets of Philadelphia, Tom Martinez was ready for action. And he found it with Bob Mathews, founder of the most violent secret racist society in America, The Order. The charismatic Mathews was a leader Martinez could follow to hell and back. And he did - through counterfeiting, knowledge of bombings, robbery and murder, and, finally, horrified awareness. Martinez had been seduced by the rhetoric into a group whose racial hatred resulted in the largest armored car robbery in American history, and the killing of Denver talk-show host Alan Berg. Here is his riveting story: the vivid, harrowing details of life inside The Order, and how he regained his conscience and his manhood by going undercover for the FBI to bring the group down. Thomas Martinez has refused the security of the Witness Protection Program. To this day he journeys across the country, a marked man, risking his life to warn of the dangers of the neo-Nazi right. His extraordinary story packs the power of a first-rate thriller. But in America today, it is the bone-chilling truth. Updated for iUniverse.com by the author, this story packs the power of a first-rate thriller!</p><p>Thomas Martinez grew up poor in the very segregated Philadelphia of the 1960s . Martinez was drawn to hate groups and the ideal of white supremacy through a sense of disenfranchisement that affected many of his contemporaries during the turbulent Sixties. By the time he was 21, Martinez was disillusioned and became seduced by the handsome eloquence of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. By his late twenties, Martinez?s fervor for the Klan had begun to wane, and his faith in the quasi-religion of hate had reached an unavoidable stage of doubt. But the need to belong guided his continued involvement in various hate groups such as the National Alliance, Christian Identity, and eventually Bob Matthew?s own organization, The Order. It eventually became too much for Martinez, the knowledge of deaths he never intended, violence he never endorsed, but there was always the support?money, counterfeit and otherwise?that he needed for his growing family. And before long, even that became too much? He had allowed himself to go to far, and the time for redemption was fading quickly?it was 1984, and Martinez, seeking to right his wrongs, became an FBI informant.Thomas Martinez has refused the government offer of the Witness Protection Program, and lives in hiding.

His personal journey is proof positive that people can change. -- <i>Rabbi Abraham Cooper, Simon Wiesenthal Center</i><br><br>Within the span of two months, America has witnessed three separate but equally despicable and horrifying acts of violence aimed at religious and ethnic minorities: the firebombing of synagogues in Sacramento, a killing spree targeting Blacks, Jews and Asians in Illinois and Indiana, and the barbaric shootings of Jewish day school and the slaying of a Filipino-American postal worker in Los Angeles. Each incident sadly, has been linked to followers of extremist groups whose venomous message of racial superiority and hate may have spurred them to action. <p>As an insider who blew the whistle on the violent nature of Americas far-right fringe, Tom Martinez offers a compelling and chilling reminder of the potentially explosive nature of hate. He convincingly demonstrates how racial and religious prejudice can be exploited by hate-filled extremists to serve a criminal cause. His story has new immediacy in the light of recent tragedies. -- <i>Abraham H.

At this time, the Sunni Muslim &#39;Abb�sid Caliphate, with its capital at Baghdad, ruled virtually the entire Islamic world. Islamic military power peaked in the 9th century, but by the end of this golden age in the 11th century, the &#39;Abb�sid Caliphs had little political and virtually no military power. Featuring numerous photographs of artefacts and eight full colour plates by Graham Turner, David Nicolle&#39;s book examines the recruitment, organization, weaponry and uniforms of the armies of the Caliphates from 862-1098.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.David Nicolle was born in 1944, the son of the illustrator Pat Nicolle. He worked in the BBC Arabic service for a number of years before going &#39;back to school&#39;, gaining an MA from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, and a doctorate from Edinburgh University. He later taught world and Islamic art and architectural history at Yarmuk University, Jordan. He has written many books and articles on medieval and Islamic warfare, and has been a prolific author of Osprey titles for many years.

The hero Richius is fighting a war he does not believe in for an emperor he loathes. Quite minor incidents come back to haunt him--he prevents a rape and makes a mortal enemy of a rival commander, and the almost casual decision to remain in a tavern in the company of prostitutes produces an obsession that dominates his life. <p>Marco's frequent clumsiness of style and plotting are almost irrelevant; Richius is a flawed hero whose sense of his own righteousness costs those around him even more than it does him, and there is a real power to his story. This is a book with some splendidly corrupt villains--the Emperor Arkus, obsessed with the pursuit of longevity and the manipulation of everyone around him; Biaggio, his smoothly vicious chief of police--and with opponents of whom we learn more when Richius is forced to change sides; Tharn, the fundamentalist wizard and warlord; and his aging servant Voris. <i>--Roz Kaveney, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>From debut author John Marco comes a thrilling military fantasy, an epic tale of ancient lands and races locked in a bloody conflict between dark science and unstoppable magic.<p>His enemies call Prince Richius "the Jackal", but he is merely a reluctant warrior for the Emperor in the fight for the strife-ridden borderland of Lucel-Lor.

To him they lead to one horrifying conclusion--a killer is on the loose and preying on his city. From the master of L.A. noir comes this beautiful and brutal tale of a cop and a criminal squared off in a life and death struggle.</p><p>James Ellroy was born in Los Angeles in 1948. His L.A.

He lives on the California coast.L.J. Ganser throws himself into his reading of Ellroy's noir account of crime and corruption in Los Angeles, and the result is often spot-on. Ellroy piles on the lurid adjectives, using vivid over-the-top dialogue. Ganser enters into the spirit of both, snarling, shrieking, and, from the sound of it, nearly spitting with the intensity of the delivery. The result is often great fun. However, at times the reading is a bit off from what the text indicates; sometimes Ganser delivers a line at normal volume only to end with a speech tag along the lines of "he shouted."

Kindergarten-Grade 1&#x2014;In the tradition of Crockett Johnson's <i>Harold and the Purple Crayon</i> (HarperCollins, 1955), McCarty delivers a character who draws objects to life. This story, however, has a modern touch and an interesting psychological twist. Readers meet Jeremy, a blond, spike-haired boy garbed in a pink-striped shirt emblazoned with a large 3, alone in his third-floor apartment, gazing at a group of children playing ball below. The text reads, "He had his very own room. He never left. He never went outside." But Jeremy does have a fancy pen, and one day he conjures up a robust blue monster that, in short order, demands a sandwich, a checkerboard, a television, and a hot dog, which Jeremy and his pen quickly supply. Soon the novelty wears off and when the monster demands a hat because he is "going out," Jeremy is relieved to see him go. The monster returns, but Jeremy takes charge and when he departs for good, the neighborhood children gather&#x2014;"Do you want to play ball?" they ask, and indeed Jeremy does. McCarty matches his understated story with both black-and-white and color illustrations that flow loosely across ample white space; the openness of the images gives just the right feel to the tale. The monster is not particularly scary, and the balance of power, which comes not from might but from Jeremy's ingenuity, is the book's strength. Both story and illustration leave lots of room for speculation and discussion; children will love to pore over the endpapers, as well.&#x2014;<i>Barbara Elleman, Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, Amherst, MA</i> END</p><h2>Vivian Suter</h2><p><p>Swiss Argentine painter Vivian Suter (born 1949) moved to a former coffee plantation in Panajachel, Guatemala, where she has created her nature-inspired, large-scale abstract paintings since 1982.

Their exploits were reported regularly in the newspapers&#x2014;often outside the sports pages&#x2014;and their fame and wealth dwarfed those of other athletes. Long after their heyday, these icons continue to be synonymous with the &#x201c;sweet science.&#x201d;<br><br>In The Boxing Kings: When American Heavyweights Ruled the Ring, Paul Beston profiles these larger-than-life men who held a central place in American culture. Among the figures covered are John L. Sullivan, who made the heavyweight championship a commercial property; Jack Johnson, who became the first black man to claim the title; Jack Dempsey, a sporting symbol of the Roaring Twenties; Joe Louis, whose contributions to racial tolerance and social progress transcended even his greatness in the ring; Rocky Marciano, who became an embodiment of the American Dream; Muhammad Ali, who took on the U.S. government and revolutionized professional sports with his showmanship; and Mike Tyson, a hard-punching dynamo who typified the modern celebrity. <br><br>This gallery of flawed but sympathetic men also includes comics, dandies, bookworms, divas, ex-cons, workingmen, and even a tough-guy-turned-preacher. As the heavyweight title passed from one claimant to another, their stories opened a window into the larger history of the United States. Boxing fans, sports historians, and those interested in U.S. race relations as it intersects with sports will find this book a fascinating exploration into how engrained boxing once was in America&#x2019;s social and cultural fabric.</p><p>Paul Beston is managing editor of City Journal, published by the Manhattan Institute. His writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, City Journal, Real Clear Sports, The American Spectator, The American Conservative, The Christian Science Monitor, The Millions, and The New York Journal of Books, as well as on the boxing website The Sweet Science.Boxing is a sport, but the heavyweight title is also an institution. As former Black Panther leader Eldridge Cleaver once wrote, &#x201c;The boxing ring is the ultimate focus of masculinity in America, the two-fisted testing ground of manhood, and the heavyweight champion, as a symbol, is the real Mr. America.&#x201d; He is the man who, as John L. Sullivan boasted, could walk into any saloon anywhere and announce, &#x201c;I can lick any son-of-a-bitch in the world.&#x201d; As an institution&#x2014;as the "real Mr. America"&#x2014;the heavyweight champion is loaded heavy with cultural baggage. For more than a century, he spoke eloquently, if sometimes silently, about the changing nature of masculinity, race, and even international politics in America and the world. Beston, a journalist, explores the century of American heavyweight dominance&#x2014;from its rise in the era of John L. Sullivan and Jack Johnson, to its height in the period of Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis, to the slow decline during the years of Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson. His analysis lends insight not just into reins of the champions, but what they meant to the larger social canvas of their times. A compelling study. Summing Up: Recommended. All readers. (<i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Attempting to condense more than a century of heavyweight boxing champions into a single and cohesive narrative is a daunting task. But that&#x2019;s exactly what The Boxing Kings: When American Heavyweights Ruled the Ring sets out to do. And it succeeds admirably.... The level of detail is impressive, indicative of meticulous research.... Simply put, The Boxing Kings is a delight - a comprehensive history that segues smoothly through the years and one which should appeal to both hardcore fight fans and those with little previous knowledge of the heavyweight division&#x2019;s storied past. An outstanding book. Thoroughly recommended. (<i>Boxing Monthly</i>)<br><br>The most feared man on the planet used to be The Boxing Heavyweight Champion of the World. Sadly, those days are long gone. However, with great books like The Boxing Kings: When American Heavyweights Ruled the Ring by Paul Beston set to come out soon, the interest in boxing will only increase. Beston harkens back to some of the greatest, if not all of the greatest days of the American Heavyweight in this thrilling book. It is a can&#x2019;t miss and I would highly suggest ordering your copy today! (<i>Neo Sport Insiders</i>)<br><br>It's not a bad time, then, for a review of the subject. Paul Beston jumps all in with his fine book, The Boxing Kings.... The major stars receive much of the coverage here, and deservedly so. Still, all of the heavyweight champions receive a mention here, including those who seemed to have the title for about an hour. And almost every bout is mentioned. The classic fights - Ali-Frazier, Tunney-Dempsey, Louis-Schmeling, etc. - are covered in much more detail, and Beston comes up with some new material that will surprise even some veteran fans. Beston is the managing editor of City Journal, and has written for several newspapers, magazines and websites. He obviously knows his stuff, and that shows up on every page here. The Boxing Kings, then, takes us back to a time when boxing mattered.... [T]hose looking for information on the subject will find this an excellent source of material. Four stars. (<i>Sports Book Review Center</i>)<br><br>In The Boxing Kings, Paul Beston, managing editor of City Journal, gives a thorough and readable tour d&#x2019;horizon of the heavyweight championship from John L. Sullivan in the late 19th century, when spectator sports were first capturing the attention of Americans, though the sad end of Iron Mike Tyson&#x2019;s bizarre career, which featured a meteoric rise followed by near free-fall.... Boxing is clearly a lifetime love of Beston&#x2019;s. But in Kings he doesn&#x2019;t attempt to hide the dark underside of the sport, which includes mob influence, thrown fights for the benefit of gamblers, larcenous promoters and managers who cheated fighters of what they earned in the ring, ravenous television executives who enabled the proliferation of sanctioning agencies and new weight divisions that produce bogus champions by the dozens. But for all the brutality and corruption of boxing, Beston is able to see and share with readers the thrills and beauty of the sweet science. Boxing fans, and those who know and/or love boxing fans, should get this fine book. Or at least tell Santa about it. (<i>The American Spectator</i>)<br><br>[A] nice read.... Beston provides nicely detailed portraits of the major champions, and elegant snapshots of those who were the less than legendary. He's especially handy with the quick one liner that puts a champion in perspective, such as when he calls Rocky Marciano, &#x2018;an embodiment of American striving,&#x2019; or describes Larry Holmes as &#x2018;boxing's version of a venture capitalist.&#x2019; Naturally, the largest sections of the story belong to Louis and Ali, but for my money the best part of any book such as this one is the period from Sullivan to Dempsey.... The Boxing Kings is a fine book, partly because Beston portrays the fighters not as unblemished heroes, but as flawed, fallible men. (<i>This Dazzling Time</i>)<br><br>The Boxing Kings: When American Heavyweights Ruled the Ring, is not only a book on the lineage of heavyweight champions from John L. Sullivan to Mike Tyson, but it's also a history lesson through a boxing lens.... The Boxing Kings is as entertaining as it is educational. (<i>Cleveland.com</i>)<br><br>What Beston does brilliantly throughout the book is give us both sides. Yes, the sociological impact is important, but for the diehard boxing fan, it&#x2019;s the fights that have to take center stage, and his exhaustive research brings us ringside through his own observations of old fight films and the accounts of the reporters of the day. (<i>BoxingScene.com</i>)<br><br>Paul Beston&#x2019;s The Boxing Kings approaches the sport&#x2019;s champs in the premier division the way a historian would examine a kingly succession. . . . Beston&#x2019;s book has that magic, and he deftly calls upon his predecessors to fill out his book with beauty and authority. His description of the fight between Rocky Marciano and Joe Louis is compact, swift, and efficient. (<i>National Review</i>)<br><br>The Boxing Kings shows off an expert knowledge of the sport&#x2019;s history fitting for someone who can still recall by memory boxing&#x2019;s Dewey decimal number, as well as a talent for archival storytelling.

He lives in Santa Barbara and San Francisco, California.Richo is the psychotherapist and teacher whose popular and impressive <i>How to Be an Adult in Relationships</i> melded Jungian and Buddhist thought in a way that was both poetic and linear. This book is lighter than his earlier works and a quick read. Proposing 52 commitments, or intentions, he follows each one with a pithy essay or meditation. Richo's intellectual grasp is profound, making each commitment an intriguing spiritual yardstick for examining how far we have come or how far we might still go in terms of honesty, kindness and taking responsibility for our actions and relationships. One of the commitments, for example, is I am choosing to be more authentic in my relationships. Fleshing this out, Richo encourages the reader to admit one's error the minute we notice ourselves acting in ways that do not present ourselves honestly. Other parts of the book deal with seeing ourselves clearly, not hurting others and showing kindness when others rebuff us. People who have not been exposed to Richo's earlier books should enjoy this one, and fans of his work will welcome the return of his unique voice. <i>(Dec. 18)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Where do these services come from? How are they transported? The answer is infrastructure, or the inner, and sometimes invisible, workings of the city. Roads, railroads, bridges, telephone wires, and power lines are visible elements of the infrastructure; sewers, plumbing pipes, wires, tunnels, cables, and sometimes rails are usually buried underground or hidden behind walls. <i>Engineering the City</i> tells the fascinating story of infrastructure as it developed through history along with the growth of cities. Experiments, games, and construction diagrams show how these structures are built, how they work, and how they affect the environment of the city and the land outside it.<br></p><p><strong>Matthys Levy, an architectural engineer, is a principal of Weidlinger Associates, a structural engineering firm.

It is a vivid portrait of the poet and her times as well as a fascinating interpretive study of the poems that will enable every reader to approach them with new understanding and delight.</p><p><b>Cynthia Griffin Wolff</b> holds the Class of 1922 Professorship of the Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is the author of <i>A Feast of Words: The Triumph of Edith Wharton</i> and <i>Samuel Richardson and the Eighteenth Century Puritan Character.</i>This is a dense, extended study of Dickinson's life and poetry, the first attempting this perilous joining since Thomas Johnson's Emily Dickinson (1955). Wolff, expanding on Tate ("New England Culture and Emily Dickinson," 1932), deflects the peril by positing that the passion in the poetry arises from Dickinson's lifelong wrestling with an abandoning, vengeful God. This single perspective illuminates poetry Christian in idea or imagery but convolutes when applied to nonfaith poems. Biographical revelations arise from the reconsideration of known data, yielding a complex portrait and some plausible conjectures in a context profuse with family, ancestry, and social history. The rich interweaving of times, life, mind, and letters makes this a formidable addition to the canon of enduring Dickinson studies.

In this fascinating collection of rare archival images from the late-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century, authors David L. Chapman and Patricia Vertinsky trace the peculiar yet fascinating history of muscular women in popular culture.</p><p>One of the battlefields in this cultural conflict appeared in popular imagery: posters, advertisements, comic books, magazine illustrations, and (most particularly) photography all offered outlets of expression for many muscular women. Until quite recently, however, such females were packaged for the general public as physical monstrosities, lesbian man-haters, kinky sex objects, or beautiful living statues. At the same time, many women, including those in the emerging female bodybuilder community, have had to fight hard to reclaim the image of female muscularity as their own.</p><p>Featuring some two hundred full-color and black-and-white illustrations, many never before published, <i>Venus with Biceps</i> is a beautiful and historically significant book about gender, image, social expectations, and female power.</p><p><b>David L.

As her narrative shifts from room to room, object to object, she paints a moving portrait of an era of rapid change -- and of the family that changed with the times. As she charts the course of the domestic tensions of class and community among her relatives, she brings to life the effects of the horrors of the Russian Revolution and the Holocaust through portraits of the refugees who came to live with them. A fascinating, intimate social history of its times, A House Unlocked is an eloquent meditation on place and time, memory and history, and above all a tribute to the meaning of home.</p><p>Penelope Lively is the author of over twenty books of fiction and non--fiction, including the Booker Prize-winning novel Moon Tiger and the Whitbread Award-winning novel A Stitch in Time, as well as numerous children&#39;s books.Lively&#39;s awards include the Booker Prize, the Whitbread Award, the British Arts Council National Book Award, and the Carnegie MedalIn the late 1990s, critically acclaimed English author Penelope Lively had to sell her country home, which had been in the family since 1925. It is to our benefit that its loss triggered her decision to "see if the private life of a house could be made to bear witness to the public traumas of a century." In a rich, clear voice, Sheila Mitchell gives a nuanced reading of the fascinating story that resulted. It's a history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century England revealed through familial artifacts. The house's extensive tulip garden leads Lively to the botanical adventurers who found the unusual specimens. An unused wing of the house reminds her of the London children housed there throughout WWII, and causes her to explore the way in which that temporary but huge migration changed English society forever.

Italian Mafiosi are hunting journalist-activist Babette Bellini, and the body count is growing as they close in on their prey. In desperation, Bellini seeks help from her former lover, Montale. Before he has time to shake off his most recent hangover, Montale is receiving sinister phone calls from men with Italian accents who want him to find Bellini for them. Like a woman he can't leave, like strong liquor he can't refuse, Marseilles lures Montale back into its violent embrace.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a Marseilles that will break your heart. A modern city and an ancient Mediterranean port, a melting pot of ethnicities and a cauldron boiling with human passions, a place of natural splendor and of sudden violence.<br><br><i>Solea </i>is Izzo's heartfelt cry against the criminal forces corrupting his beloved city. It is his farewell to Marseilles and to its ideal protagonist, Fabio Montale. It concludes an unforgettable trilogy that epitomizes the aspirations and ideals of the Mediterranean noir movement.</p><p><b>Jean-Claude Izzo</b>&nbsp;was born in Marseilles in 1945. Best known for the Marseilles trilogy (<i>Total Chaos</i>,&nbsp;<i>Chourmo</i>,&nbsp;<i>Solea</i>), Izzo is also the author of&nbsp;<i>The Lost Sailors</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Sun for the Dying</i>. Izzo is widely credited with being the founder of the modern Mediterranean noir movement. He died in 2000 at the age of firty-five.The concluding volume of the late Izzo's Marseilles trilogy remains utterly uncompromising in its allegiance to the classic noir worldview. Fabio Montale, the embittered former cop, sees nothing but misery in his own future and in the future of his beloved city, but he still tries to protect those he loves from similar fates. Ah, but in a noir world, any spot of tenderness is a point of vulnerability, and sure enough, the Italian Mafiosi, desperate to silence Montale's former lover, investigative journalist Babette, target Fabio's friends as the way to pry from him the information they need. There is a eulogistic tone to this novel, not only because it is Izzo's last, but because he seems to be saying farewell to possibility, farewell even to the idea of constructing a separate peace out of harm's way from the world. A Jim Thompson&#x2013;like ending&#x2014;served with Izzo's no-frills lyricism&#x2014;pretty well seals the deal: "Could you draw the curtains on our life? I'm tired." The sun shines brightly in Marseilles, but Izzo's Mediterranean noir is as dark as noir can get.

His paper led to a revolution in thinking&#x2015;to a new worldview. <em>Eco-Economy</em> discusses the need today for a similar shift in our worldview. The issue now is whether the environment is part of the economy or the economy is part of the environment. Lester R. Brown argues the latter, pointing out that treating the environment as part of the economy has produced an economy that is destroying its natural support systems. Brown notes that if China were to have a car in every garage, American style, it would need 80 million barrels of oil a day&#x2015;more than the world currently produces. If paper consumption per person in China were to reach the U.S. level, China would need more paper than the world produces. There go the world's forests. If the fossil fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economic model will not work for China, it will not work for the other 3 billion people in the developing world&#x2015;and it will not work for the rest of the world. But Brown is optimistic as he describes how to restructure the global economy to make it compatible with the Earth's ecosystem so that economic progress can continue. In the new economy, wind farms replace coal mines, hydrogen-powered fuel cells replace internal combustion engines, and cities are designed for people, not cars. Glimpses of the new economy can be seen in the wind farms of Denmark, the solar rooftops of Japan, and the bicycle network of the Netherlands. <em>Eco-Economy</em> is a road map of how to get from here to there.</p><p>Lester R. Brown&nbsp;is the founder of the Earth Policy and Worldwatch Institutes. He has been honored with numerous prizes, including a MacArthur Fellowship, the United Nations Environment Prize, and twenty-five honorary degrees. He lives in Washington, D.C.Eco-economic theory calls for harmony between our economy and natural resources. Our current, untenable, profit-focused economic model, says Brown (Building a Sustainable Society), depletes forests, oil, farmland, topsoil, water, atmosphere and species beyond a sustainable level. Brown, founding director of the Earth Policy Institute, uses the Sumerians as an antimodel: as the land was overworked, water sources eventually disappeared. And he uses forestry as a counterexample: forests secure land and store water, acting as natural dams. Logging delivers paychecks, but doesn't consider flood damage from tree loss. Eco-economists would say that the logger and the town, while temporarily profiting, pay more in the end in rising insurance costs, flood damage to homes and infrastructure, increased taxes and disaster relief funds. The goal, presented here in convincing detail, is to design a profitable economy that accurately reflects the social cost of abuse of resources. Brown suggests shifting "taxes from income to environmentally destructive activities, such as carbon emissions." Individuals and towns should receive tax breaks for deploying solar and wind-generated power. However receptive to Brown's excellent, sophisticated proposals, many readers will wonder how they can become reality; for eco-economics to work, all world leaders would need to agree on what makes practices environmentally unsound. (Nov. 5)Forecast: In light of the current administration's poor reputation for eco-concern and its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, Brown's book will do well among students, activists and the growing environmental movement.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Five Portraits (The Xanth Novels)</h2><p><b>The magical land of Xanth is in peril in this follow-up to<i> Board Stiff </i>by <i>New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author Piers Anthony.</b><br> &nbsp;<br><i>&#x201c;It occurs to me that you folk are no ordinary group,&#x201d; the troll said.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i>&#x201c;We're on a special mission to eliminate the last of the anti-pun virus.

From the persistence of difference in <i>Othello</i> to the matter of character in <i>Hamlet</i> to the untimeliness of youth in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Garber discusses how these ideas have been re-imagined in modern fiction, theater, film, and the news, and in the literature of psychology, sociology, political theory, business, medicine, and law. <b>Shakespeare and Modern Culture</b> is a brilliant recasting of our own mental and emotional landscape as refracted through the prism of the protean Shakespeare.</p><p><b>Marjorie Garber<i> </i></b>is William R.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.INTRODUCTION<br>The premise of this book is simple and direct: Shakespeare makes modern culture and modern culture makes Shakespeare. I could perhaps put the second "Shakespeare" in quotation marks, so as to indicate that what I have in mind is our <i>idea </i>of Shakespeare and of what is Shakespearean. But in fact it will be my claim that Shakespeare and "Shakespeare" are perceptually and conceptually the same from the viewpoint of any modern observer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Characters like Romeo, Hamlet, or Lady Macbeth have become cultural types, instantly recognizable when their names are invoked. As will become clear, the modern versions of these figures often differ significantly from their Shakespearean "originals": a "Romeo" is a persistent romancer and philanderer rather than a lover faithful unto death, a "Hamlet" is an indecisive overthinker, and a "Lady Macbeth," in the public press, is an ambitious female politician who will stop at nothing to gain her own ends. But the very changes marked by these appropriations tell a revealing story about modern culture and modern life.<br>&nbsp;<br>The idea that Shakespeare is modern is, of course, hardly a modern idea. Indeed, it is one of the fascinating effects of Shakespeare's plays that they have almost always seemed to coincide with the times in which they are read, published, produced, and discussed. But the idea that Shakespeare writes us-as if we were Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, constantly encountering our own prescripted identities, proclivities, beliefs, and behaviors-is, if taken seriously, both exciting and disconcerting.<br>&nbsp;<br>I will suggest in what follows that Shakespeare has scripted many of the ideas that we think of as "naturally" our own and even as "naturally" true: ideas about human character, about individuality and selfhood, about government, about men and women, youth and age, about the qualities that make a strong leader. Such ideas are not necessarily first encountered today in the realm of literature-or even of drama and theater. Psychology, sociology, political theory, business, medicine, and law have all welcomed and recognized Shakespeare as the founder, authorizer, and forerunner of important categories and practices in their fields. Case studies based on Shakespearean characters and events form an important part of education and theory in leadership institutes and business schools as well as in the history of psychoanalysis. In this sense Shakespeare has made modern culture, and modern culture returns the favor.<br>&nbsp;<br>The word "Shakespearean" today has taken on its own set of connotations, often quite distinct from any reference to Shakespeare or his plays. A cartoon by Bruce Eric Kaplan in <i>The New Yorker </i>shows a man and a woman walking down a city street, perhaps headed for a theater or a movie house. The caption reads, "I don't mind if something's Shakespearean, just as long as it's not Shakespeare." "Shakespearean" is now an all- purpose adjective, meaning great, tragic, or resonant: it's applied to events, people, and emotions, whether or not they have any real relevance to Shakespeare.<br>&nbsp;<br>Journalists routinely describe the disgrace of a public leader as a "downfall of Shakespearean proportions"-as for example in the case of Canadian financier Conrad Black, whose plight was also called a "fall from grace of Shakespearean proportions," and who was described as the victim of a "betrayal of almost Shakespearean proportion." In a book on the U.S. military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, a former CIA officer describes the results as "self- imposed tragedies of unplanned- for length and Shakespearean proportions." Here the word "tragedies" makes the link between military misadventures and Shakespearean drama. The effect of a series of Danish cartoons that gave offense to Muslims was "Shakespearean in proportions"; the final episodes of <i>The Sopranos </i>were "a bloodbath of Shakespearean proportions"; and the steroid scandal in professional baseball was a plot that had"thickened to Shakespearean proportions."<br>&nbsp;<br>Vivid personalities like Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and William Randolph Hearst have likewise been described as figures of "Shakespearean proportions" or "Shakespearean dimensions." Nor is it only national or international news that now makes the Shakespeare grade: a headline in the <i>Daily Telegraph </i>of London declared that "throwing a children's party can be a drama of Shakespearean proportions." And an article in the tabloid <i>New York Post </i>began, "A Shakespearean tragedy played out on a Long Island street where a boozed- up young woman unknowingly dragged her boyfriend under her car for more than a block as he tried to stop her from driving drunk." "Shakespearean" in these contexts means something like "ironic" or "astonishing" or "uncannily well plotted." Over time the adjectival form of the playwright's name has become an intensifier, indicating a degree of magnitude, a scale of effect.<br>&nbsp;<br>Why should this be the case? And what does it say about the interrelationship between Shakespeare and modern culture?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>"Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how," says one earnest young man in a Jane Austen novel to another. "It is a part of an Englishman's constitution," his companion is quick to concur. "No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree," he says, "from one's earliest years. His celebrated passages are quoted by every body; they are in half the books we open and we all talk Shakespeare, use his similes, and describe with his descriptions." This was modern culture, circa 1814. In the view of these disarmingly ordinary, not very bookish observers, Shakespeare was the author of their common language, the poet and playwright who inspired and shaped their thought.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1828 Sir Walter Scott, already a celebrated novelist, "visited the tomb of the mighty wizard," as he wrote. He had a plaster cast made of the Shakespeare portrait bust in Holy Trinity Church, and he designed "a proper shrine for the Bard of Avon" in the library of his home at Abbotsford, making sure that the bust was "fitted with an altar worthy of himself." Scott noticed that the two of them-Scott and Shakespeare-shared the same initials, W.S. He had their head sizes measured and compared by a German phrenologist. A bust of Scott was designed to resemble that of the other Bard, and after Scott's death the bust of <i>his </i>head replaced that of Shakespeare in the library. Admiration here became identification-or perhaps a kind of rivalry.<br>&nbsp;<br>Shakespeare's modernity would also be proclaimed in nineteenth- century America. In 1850 Ralph Waldo Emerson announced that, after centuries in which Shakespeare had been inadequately understood, the time was finally right for him: "It was not possible to write the history of Shakespeare till now," Emerson wrote. The word "now" in his argument becomes the marker of that shifting category of the modern, and it is repeated for emphasis a few lines later. "Now, literature, philosophy, and thought, are Shakespearized. His mind is the horizon beyond which, at present, we do not see. Our ears are educated to music by his rhythm."13 Thus Emerson could say of Shakespeare, simply and resoundingly, "he wrote the text of modern life." We live today in a new "now," a century and a half removed from Emerson's, but this sentiment-"he wrote the text of modern life"-seems as accurate as it did then.<br>&nbsp;<br>Nor-as we have already noted-is this view the special province of literary authors. The frequency with which practitioners and theorists of many of the "new" modern sciences and social sciences-anthropology, psychology, sociology-have turned to Shakespeare for inspiration is striking, but not surprising. Ernest Jones, Freud's friend and biographer, the first English language practitioner of psychoanalysis, declared straightforwardly (in an essay he began in 1910, revised in 1923, and expanded in the 1940s)that "Shakespeare was the first modern." Why? Because he understood so well the issues of psychology. "The essential difference between prehistoric and civilized man," Jones argued, was that "the difficulties with which the former had to contend came from without," while "those with which the latter have to contend really come from within,"<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;This inner conflict modern psychologists know as neurosis, and it is only by study of neurosis that one can learn the fundamental motives and instincts that move men. Here, as in so many other respects, Shakespeare was the first modern.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Thus for Jones, Shakespeare's use of the soliloquy, the onstage, interior questioning of a character's conflicted thoughts and motives, anticipated the new science of psychoanalysis and Freud's "talking cure." <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;THE "text of modern life" these days is embedded in a network of text messaging, Internet connections, video clips, and file sharing. Shakespeare in our culture is already disseminated, scattered, appropriated, part of the cultural language, high and low. An advertisement for rugged outdoors types advertised a sale: "Now Is the Winter of Our Discount Tents." This turned out also to be the name of a rock compilation by the label Twisted Nerve. At the same time, in London, the White Cube Gallery presented an exhibition of work by British artist Neal Tait, titled "Now Is the Discount of Our Winter Tents." Manifestly, none of these tweaked or inverted phrases would offer much in the way of wit or appeal if the cultural consumer did not recognize, or half recognize, the phrase on which each is based: the opening soliloquy of <i>Richard III, </i>in which the envious and aspiring Gloucester observes, in a classic of double- meaning enjambment, that "Now is the winter of our discontent / Made glorious summer by this son of York" (1.1.1-2). So we might say that Shakespeare is already not only modern but postmodern: a simulacrum, a replicant, a montage, a bricolage. A collection of found objects, repurposed as art.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our Shakespeare is often "sampled" and "texted" in forms from advertising to cartoon captions. Lady Macbeth's exclamation in the sleepwalking scene, "Out, damned spot!" (<i>Macbeth </i>4.1.33), is so well-known that it has been used to describe stain removers, acne medicine, and cleaning technologies for semiconductors. An ad for Hard Candy cosmetics extends the literary allusion, offering not only the "Out Damn Spot" concealer pencil to cover up blemishes, but also a coordinated line of makeup called "Macbare" and "Macbuff." I call this a "literary allusion," but it is a quite different kind from those of an earlier period. Although the writers of copy here assume a recognition of <i>Macbeth </i>as the source, there is no extended expectation of familiarity with the text. The wit inheres in the <i>dis</i>location from context("Lay on, Macbuff "?).<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Popular culture examples of this kind are virtually ubiquitous. Hamlet's phrase "The undiscover'd country from whose bourn / No traveller returns" (<i>Hamlet </i>3.1.79-80) has been used as the subtitle of <i>Star Trek VI, </i>the title of an art exhibition on representational painting at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, and the brand name of a company offering bicycle tours in California. The bionic skeleton used for decades by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to demonstrate artificial body parts was named Yorick, after "the exhumed skull in Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet.</i>" Sometimes the Shakespeare quotation has moved so far into the mainstream that there is little or no acknowledgment of any connection with the source. Economist Greg Mankiw chose the phrase "Strange Bedfellows" as the headline of a short piece on Al Gore and supply- side economists of the 1980s. Although there may have been some tacit comparison between these figures and Shakespeare's Caliban and Trinculo, there's no evidence of it in the piece-and really no necessity. Shakespeare sampled, Shakespeare quoted without quotation marks, has become a lingua franca of modern cultural exchange.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cultural "Q" value of something often goes up when its familiarity and utility go down. An antique shop that specializes in folk art will display objects like churns, crocks, quilts, and spinning wheels-once valued for their use and now many times more valuable, in sheer dollar terms, despite being useless. And the further we get as a society from intimate knowledge of the language and characters of the plays, the more "love" of Shakespeare begins to be expressed as a cultural value. Shakespeare's plays are probably read and studied more, these days, <i>before </i>and <i>after </i>college-in high school and in reading groups, extension courses, lifelong learning and leadership institutes, and in the preparation of audiences attending play productions-than during the four years of traditional undergraduate college education. Preprofessional training starts earlier, college majors are more specialized than once they were, and there is less expectation of a broad general education or liberal arts foundation than was the case a generation or two ago. Shakespeare becomes the treat, as well as the all- purpose cultural upgrade, for which time is found later in life, after more basic, pragmatic skills and knowledge are acquired.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thus it is not perhaps a surprise to discover that some of the most avid and interested students of Shakespeare today are businesspeople, CEOs and CFOs of major national and international companies. Shakespeare's plays are now being used, regularly and with success, to teach corporate executives lessons about business. A few of the analogies the CEOs and their facilitators make may seem facile (the appearance of the ghost of old Hamlet is like the reminder that executives are accountable to their shareholders; CEOs, like the kings and queens in the plays, have to face the necessity of betraying-or firing-their friends). But the business of teaching Shakespeare- in- business has become popular and lucrative as a sideline for both government officials no longer in power and Shakespeare companies struggling to make a living. The play that has most galvanized business leaders has been <i>Henry V, </i>whose protagonist, the leader of a "band of brothers," produced unit cohesion and triumphed against apparently insurmountable odds; I use some of the discussions among what might be called "business Shakespeareans" as examples in my chapter on that play.<br>&nbsp;<br>In these encounters, "Shakespeare" often becomes a standardized plot, a stereotypical character, and, especially, a moral or ethical choice-not to mention the ubiquitous favorite, "a voice of authority," as if it were possible to locate "his" voice among the mix of Hamlet, Macbeth, Falstaff, Rosalind, Portia, Iago, the Ghost, and the Fool. (The CEOs are not often asked to see the play through the lens of a minor character, an old man, a young woman, an attendant lord, or a common soldier; they are kings and queens, generals, Machiavels, decision makers all.) What may sometimes drop out here, crucially, is the complexity of language and of plotting, the ultimate undecidability or overdetermination of phrases, words, and actions. Reading against the grain-trying to gather a multiplicity of sometimes conflicting meanings from any staged scene or passage-itself cuts against the grain of CEO management and decision- making. Perhaps the key phrase here ought to be, not "Falstaff, <i>c'est moi</i>"-as one executive was quoted as saying-but instead Iago's "I am not what I am."<br></p><h2>Sowed to Death (Farmer&#39;s Daughter Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the second Farmer&#x2019;s Daughter Mystery from the national bestselling author of <i>No Farm, No Foul</i>, farm owner and blogger Shelby McDonald must field another murder mystery....</b><br><br>The county fair is the highlight of the year for the small town of Lovett, Michigan&#x2014;especially for food-and-lifestyle blogger Shelby McDonald, who writes as the Farmer&#x2019;s Daughter.

Used in some schools as a teaching aid. Included in the 26 chapters are descriptions of a crucial battle between Indians and Spaniards in 1759; a place where &#34;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&#34; was composed; the wild and woolly past of a town called Navajoe; a whiskey-smuggling scheme that set a train depot on fire; a young man who left the oil fields for Hollywood; a scary light that has haunted a lonely road for years; and where once a strange but lively party took place in a moonlit cemetery.</p><p>Jim Marion Etter is a retired, award-winning reporter for The Daily Oklahoman whose offbeat, folksy writing about his home state has earned him the reputation as &#34;Oklahoma&#39;s master country storyteller.&#34; A writer of both fiction and nonfiction, he&#39;s the author of five books and a contributing author of four others, and has written for numerous magazines including Persimmon Hill and Western Horsemen.

In Philippians and Philemon, Bonnie Thurston makes a convincing case that canonical Philippians is as Paul wrote it, one letter. Although there is not enough specific evidence to &#34;name names,&#34; she suggests a number of possible audiences. A translation conforming as closely as possible to the original Greek is provided, along with a careful analysis of the language of the letter that yields insights into the context and theological underpinning of this epistle. The apostle&#39;s very brief letter to Philemon stands solidly within the Pauline collection of authentic and canonical letters. In this volume, Judith Ryan argues that Philemon makes two specific appeals. The first seeks to elicit Philemon&#39;s partnership and his community&#39;s support in welcoming Onesimus back as both beloved brother and honored guest. The second requests that Onesimus be allowed to use the freedom he already has to serve Christ and his Gospel. In this commentary Ryan provides a fresh translation, critical notes for each verse, and interpretation on defined sections. She situates the letter in the historical context of slavery in the ancient world and shows how Paul combined his theology with contemporary rhetorical strategies to produce an effective challenge to his audience.</p><p>Bonnie B.

It defines with grim humor the conditions of stability and social progress. &#x201c;Physics&#x201d; in Bagehot's book, refers to natural science; &#x201c;politics&#x201d; to social science. His vastly stimulating analysis was the first important effort to comprehend the implications of the new science (especially Darwinism) for the study of political affairs. In the process, Bagehot makes unforgettably clear the complex, often tragic relation between individual and collective happiness. Roger Kimball's introduction and notes place Bagehot's ideas in perspective for today's reader and evaluate the continuing usefulness of his observations. "We go to Bagehot for something that seems very difficult to convey accurately through mere definition or single examples&#x2015;the true character of political man. This character, in turn, is important to discover, because on it depends the possibility of leading a life above &#x2018;physics,' a life better than that of the jungle."&#x2015;Jacques Barzun.</p><p>Banker, editor, political thinker, and literary critic, Walter Bagehot (1826&#x2013;1877) edited the <i>Economist</i> for the last seventeen years of his life and enjoyed intimate friendships with the leading political figures of his day.

Who is this complex man whose office grants him sole charge of the world's largest religion? How will his tenure influence the future? <i>The Essential Pope Benedict XVI</i> answers these questions through carefully chosen selections from his homilies, interviews, theological essays, and articles on the crises facing the church today. This collection lays out Benedict's thinking and relates it to a variety of contemporary issues, including modern culture's abandonment of traditional religious values, social mores regarding conception and the sanctity of life, current challenges to the priesthood, and the Catholic Church's tenuous relations with other world religions. </p> <p> First a brilliant <i>peritus</i>, or "expert advisor," to the Second Vatican Council and then archbishop of Munich, Joseph Ratzinger was appointed head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith by Pope John Paul II in 1981. As Cardinal Ratzinger, the <i>ex officio</i> defender of church doctrine, he gained a reputation as a heroic guardian of the faith for conservatives and was held in suspicion by church liberals. </p> <p> We cannot yet know what issues and events will define the reign of Pope Benedict XVI, but by any measure he will be seen as one of the most important theological voices of our time. This one volume is the best source for understanding the heart, soul, and agenda of this twenty-first-century successor to St. Peter. </p></p><p><p>A former publishing executive, John F.

Schall notes the pope's remarkable capability for writing compactly and clearly, imparting a lot of information and argument very unambiguously. That talent is everywhere evident in these sermons, lectures, and excerpts from then Cardinal Ratzinger's many books, capped by his first papal encyclical, <i>Deus Caritas Est</i> <i>(God Is Love)</i>. Because his publications number in the high hundreds, the essentiality claimed for even this large selection may raise eyebrows. But recall the skill that Schall points out, remark the topical sections of this book--"The Church," "The Liturgy," "Theology," "Scripture," "The Priesthood," and "Christian Morality"--and apprehensions dissipate. These are precisely the concerns essential to a pope. Altogether they show that, contrary to the expectations of many, Benedict is no new Pio Nino (Pius IX, famous for pushing papal infallibility through the first Vatican Council), fulminating against error. He is a conciliator, ever ready to acknowledge the worth of ideas presumably inimical to Christianity and to improve them with the truth that is Christ. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Members of the Baha'i religion believe that periodically throughout history, God has revealed Himself to humanity through Divine Messengers-among them Abraham, Zoroaster, Moses, Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad-each offering fresh spiritual teachings suited for the age in which they appear. Bowers quotes extensively from Baha'u'llah 's own writings, which Baha'is regard as the most recent Divine Revelation for humankind, providing a welcome glimpse into its power and majesty. In placing the life of Baha'u'llah at the center of the story, he reveals an authentically inspiring figure and the inseparable connection between a new religion and an extraordinary human being touched by His Creator.</p><p><b>Kenneth E. Bowers </b>currently serves as the Secretary-General of the National Spiritual Assembly, the national governing body of the Baha'is of the United States. Ken and his wife, Mojgan, have two children and live near Chicago.&#34;A member of the national Baha&#39;i governing council in the United States, Bowers is the architect of an information campaign to bring the Baha&#39;i tradition before the American public. For his first book, he has analyzed responses to the Baha&#39;i message and tailored its presentation to the contemporary audience. This new introduction holds up well beside such standard introductions as J.E. Esslemont&#39;s Baha&#39;u&#39;llah and the New Era (1923), John Ferraby&#39;s All Things Made New (1957), John Huddleston&#39;s The Earth Is but One Country (1976), and Douglas Martin and William Hatcher&#39;s The Baha&#39;i Faith (1985). Whereas the other books were organized around principles and teachings, Bowers has taken the positive step of using the life of Baha&#39;u&#39;llah as the main organizing principle for his discussion of Baha&#39;i scripture, theology, and spiritual life. He places the divine Messenger at the center and shows the religion emerging from him just as Christianity emerges from Jesus. The main criticisms involve the use of lengthy quotations and occasional references to individuals who are not named until two paragraphs later. While not an academic work with new historical findings, this book is an effective and reasonably balanced overview of this growing world religion by a believer. Recommended for public, college, and religious libraries.&#34; --- Library Journal (January 2004) &#34;In the early 19th century, Persia was in a fit of millennial expectation, awaiting the &#34;Promised One of Islam&#34; who would establish God&#39;s reign in the world. According to Bowers, a member of the national governing body of BahC!&#39;C-s in the U.S., this prophecy was fulfilled in a new religious movement. In the 1850s a figure known asBahC!&#39;u&#39;llC!h came to believe, while under religious persecution in the depths of a Persian dungeon, that he was the most recent in a succession of extraordinary &#34;Manifestations of God&#34;-including Moses, Jesus and Mohammed-each sent to guide humanity through its spiritual and political evolution to its ultimate aim: a harmonious, universal religion and an enlightened, united &#34;world commonwealth.&#34; Bowers chronicles the struggles of BahC!&#39;u&#39;llC!h and his followers, known as BahC!&#39;C-s, as they endured lethal persecutions, brutal imprisonments and the repeated exile of BahC!&#39;u&#39;llC!h himself across the Middle East. Bowers next outlines many of BahC!&#39;u&#39;llC!h&#39;s voluminous teachings, and then turns to BahC!&#39;u&#39;llC!h&#39;s legacy: his successors and their many instructions for the BahC!&#39;C- faith, ranging from principles for establishing world peace down to election protocols for local BahC!&#39;C- communities. Bowers is clearly a believer; the book is more faith-narrative than history, and at times becomes proselytizing, even preachy-quotes from BahC!&#39;C- writings are sometimes whole pages in length. Yet Bowers&#39;s comprehensive approach is balanced by an easy readability that makes the book both accessible and informative, a welcome introduction to the faith of some six million people worldwide.&#34; -- Publishers Weekly &#34;God Speaks Again: An Introduction To The Baha&#39;i Faith is simple presentation of Bahai tenets for readers of all religious and cultural backgrounds. Explaining the origins of the Bahai way through the teachings of the prophet Bahaullah (18171892), whom Bahai worldwide regard as the Messenger for God for the modern day, God Speaks Again presents Bahaullah&#39;s vision that there is but one religionand that all messengers of God, from Abraham and Zoroaster to Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, have progressively revealed its true nature. Exploring the ramifications of a single, unfolding Divine plan, hampered not by the tireless work of God&#39;s messengers but rather by the failings of human beings who are the source of religious divisions and prejudice, God Speaks Again is an absolute &#34;must-read&#34; for better understanding the Bahai faith and its spiritual message.&#34; -- The Midwest Book Review</p><h2>How To Use Tarot Spreads (How To Series, 9)</h2><p>This easy-to-use tarot guide features over three dozen spreads for answering questions about romance, career, finance, and more.

This boundary has remained virtually unchanged for 1,500 years: the European, Catholic West and the Orthodox East meet on Slav territory. There were, and still are, ethnic similarities between the peoples on either side of the divide, but their culture and history differ fundamentally. The Croats and Croatia, on the western side of the divide, are traditionally linked with Hungarian, Italian, and German regions and Western Europe, and are also influenced by their long Mediterranean coastline. Ivo Goldstein&#39;s Croatia provides a necessary, accessible history of development of what is now an independent state. Croatia includes major sections on the early medieval Croatian state (until 1101), the periods of union with Hungary (1102-1526) and with Austria (1526-1918), incorporation in Yugoslavia (1918-91) and the creation of a sovereign state. Charting social, economic, and cultural developments, Goldstein shows us that this complex historical pattern explains many of the political developments of today.</p><p>Ivo Goldstein is a Croatian historian. He received his PhD in history at the University of Zagreb.

But they chose different paths that would end at the same violent crossroads&#x2014;with considerable help from the FBI and an enigmatic, all-American snitch.<br><br> Jos� was a devoted family man who cut no corners in his pursuit of the American dream. Born in Nuevo Laredo, a Mexican border town on a crucial smuggling route, Jos� was one of thirteen children raised by a hardworking ranch hand. He grew up loving the sprawling countryside and its tough, fast quarter horses, but in search of opportunity he crossed the border into Texas to look for work as a bricklayer. He kept his nose clean. He stayed out of trouble.<br><br> Back in Mexico, Jos�&#x2019;s younger brother Miguel was leading a different life. While Jos� struggled to make ends meet, Miguel ascended to the top ranks of Los Zetas, a notoriously bloody drug cartel&#x2014;his crimes had become the stuff of legend and myth on both sides of the border. He was said to have burned rivals alive, murdered Mexican and American law enforcement officers, and launched grenades at a U.S. consulate.&nbsp;<br><br> Jos�, married with kids and now a U.S. citizen, gave every indication of rejecting his brother&#x2019;s criminal lifestyle. Then one day he showed up at a quarter-horse auction and bid close to a million dollars for a horse&#x2014;the largest amount ever paid for a quarter horse at an auction. The humble bricklayer quickly became a major player in the quarter-horse racing scene that thrived in the American Southwest and Mexico. That caught the attention of an eager young FBI agent named Scott Lawson. He enlisted Tyler Graham, an American rancher who would eventually breed Jos�&#x2019;s champion horse&#x2014;nicknamed Bones&#x2014;to help the FBI infiltrate what was revealing itself to be a major money-laundering operation, with the ultimate goal of capturing the infamous Miguel Trevi�o.<br><br> Joe Tone&#x2019;s riveting, exquisitely layered crime narrative, set against the high-stakes world of horse racing, is an intimate story about family, loyalty, and the tragic costs of a failed drug war. Compelling and complex, <i>Bones </i>sheds light on the perilous lives of American ranchers, the morally dubious machinery of drug and border enforcement, and the way greed and fear mingle with race, class, and violence along America&#x2019;s vast Southwestern border.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Bones</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The true-life tale of the Zetas&#x2019; foray into quarter horses is masterfully recounted. . . .

Maybe you&#x2019;ve leaned over the rail at your local track, hollering at the seven because you bet the seven, for reasons that made sense at the time. Maybe you&#x2019;ve donned a floppy hat and gotten hammered off mint juleps, running in from the kitchen to catch the end of&#x2014;or maybe a replay of?&#x2014;the Derby. Maybe you&#x2019;ve been in a Vegas sportsbook, where not even the immortal gods of American football can muscle the ponies off those little TVs in the corner.<br><br>Somewhere, someway, you&#x2019;ve seen a horse race. Most likely you saw thoroughbreds, the horses that were loping down the backstretch when you stumbled in from the kitchen. Maybe you watched a steeplechase, for the novelty of seeing these graceful beasts leap through a manicured obstacle course. But it&#x2019;s unlikely that you&#x2019;ve ever knowingly watched a quarter-horse race, and, for our purposes, you&#x2019;ll need to see one, if only in your mind&#x2019;s eye or on YouTube.<br><br>Be forewarned: There are no mint juleps here. The best we can offer is a lime in your Corona.<br><br>The colonists who settled Virginia and the Carolinas invented quarter-horse racing in the 1600s. It was more or less an accident.<br><br>They&#x2019;d brought a handful of Arabians and thoroughbreds with them on the voyage, and between shifts tilling the New World, they started racing through the main streets of their newly settled villages. The races were informal and short, usually about a quarter of a mile, run between two horses down straight streets lined with villagers. But winning them became a point of pride, and over time, the colonists discovered that breeding their horses with those ridden by the natives resulted in even faster racehorses. They called this new breed the quarter-of-a-mile running horse, accurately if not cleverly.<br><br>Around this time, a British military captain visited North Carolina and wrote home about his experience. He marveled at the lush tobacco fields, the &#x201c;shocking barbarities of the Indians,&#x201d; and the horses:<br><br>They are much attached to quarter racing, which is always a match between two horses to run a quarter of a mile, straight out, being merely an exertion of speed. They have a breed that performs it with astonishing velocity. . . . I am confident there is not a horse in England, or perhaps the whole world, that can excel them in rapid speed.<br><br>In the 1800s, as settlers moved west, they encountered a racing culture similar to the one established by those original colonists. Three centuries of ranching across Mexico&#x2014;including in the northern state of Coahuila y Tejas&#x2014;had propagated a breed of stock horses built for working the farm. They were short, muscular, and placid amid the chaos of a cattle herd. They were &#x201c;cow ponies,&#x201d; first and foremost. But they could run, too, if only for a few hundred yards, and their serenity with a rider in the saddle made them easy to settle down at the starting line.<br><br>The Southwest in the nineteenth century was defined by bloodshed, as Coahuila y Tejas became the Republic of Texas, and then an American state. Throughout it all, though, the white American settlers, Mexican ranchers, and Native Americans challenged each other to quarter-mile races all across the disputed territory. Gamblers would line the track, forming a human rail, with money and property at stake. One race was said to attract such prolific betting that it bankrupted and shuttered an entire Texas town.<br><br>The eastern settlers touted their &#x201c;quarter-of-a-mile running horses.&#x201d; The Texans swore by the speed and smarts of their cow ponies. An imported stallion named Steel Dust quickly extinguished the East-West rivalry. He was already thirteen when he arrived from the East in 1844, but he beat every &#x201c;cow pony&#x201d; they lined him up against. Before long he was being bred with ranch horses from across the new state of Texas, infusing the Spaniards&#x2019; placid cow-pony breed with a burst of speed and additional weight.<br><br>The resulting horses were, as one quarter-horse historian described them, &#x201c;small, [with] alert ears, a well-developed neck, sloping shoulders, short deep barrel, a great heart girth, heavy muscled in thigh and forearm, legs not too long, and firmly jointed with the knee and pastern close.&#x201d; They were rarely taller than fifteen hands but could reach twelve hundred pounds. (Thoroughbreds are lither, averaging sixteen hands but just a thousand pounds.) The new breed of horse was even better on the farm and unbeatable in a rodeo ring or on the track, provided the track wasn&#x2019;t longer than a quarter mile. They called him the American Quarter Horse.<br><br>By the 1940s, an industry had sprung forth around the breed. In Texas, a group of cowboys founded the American Quarter Horse Association, to manage and regulate breeding and competition. In New Mexico and California, businessmen pushed for pari-mutuel betting, allowing racetracks to collect the bets and manage the payouts. That lured horsemen and gamblers from Texas, Oklahoma, and Mexico for weekends spent drinking and betting on the races, which could now feature six or eight horses instead of two.<br><br>The quarter-horse meccas built in the 1940s and &#x2019;50s still anchor the sport today, especially Ruidoso Downs, in the mountains of New Mexico, and Los Alamitos, in the palm-studded suburbs of Orange County, California. They host futurities, for two-year-old racehorses, and derbies, for three-year-olds, with millions on the line. And on any given day, at tracks sprinkled across the Southwest and Mexico, quarter horses as old as five, six, even seven run races with a few grand on the line and a few hundred people in the stands.<br><br>The best of these horses are descendants from American Quarter Horse royalty&#x2014;sired by name-brand stallions like First Down Dash, Corona Cartel, or Mr Jess Perry. They&#x2019;re ridden by jockeys who often learned to ride in unsanctioned match races in the countryside of Texas, Oklahoma, or Mexico. Many of the best are Mexican immigrants.<br><br>The races typically cover between 350 and 440 yards. The best feature a little bumping out of the gate and all the way through the finish line. The fastest 440-yard races are run in about 20 seconds, compared to the two minutes it takes the top thoroughbreds to circle Churchill Downs. The short track leaves little time to overcome a stumble. the horses are loaded up, rearing and kicking up dust, and everything goes still. The gates fly and and the race is already almost over. The horse that best taps into its English-Spanish-Mexican-Tejano cow-pony DNA has the advantage, using its hulking haunches and quiet demeanor to go from dead still to full speed in a few strides.<br><br>Now maybe you can see it, even if you&#x2019;ve never seen it: stocky horses raised by cowboys, racing on short tracks, ridden by jockeys trained in the thick brush of cow country, all a safe distance from the floppy-hatted dignitaries of the Jockey Club. They call thoroughbred racing the sport of kings? This is the sport of cowboys. Muddle your mint elsewhere.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Bloodlines<br><br>Pomona, California<br><br>December 2008<br><br>The calculations started as soon as Ramiro&#x2019;s loafers shuffled into the barn, kicking dust particles into the crinkles of the cowboys&#x2019; boots. As his eyes adjusted to the dark, Ramiro&#x2019;s brain started receiving dispatches about what he was seeing: thick haunches, hinged backs, steep shoulder slopes, and all the other variables that make the difference between racehorse and runner. There were some runners in the barns this morning. That was the only takeaway from a stroll through here, some babies that would be blazing down the track by spring.<br><br>It was winter in Pomona, one of the dozens of suburbs splayed east of Los Angeles that everyone&#x2019;s heard of but few have visited, a kissing cousin to Covina and Pasadena. Ramiro was born, raised, and still lived in Monterrey, the industrial heartbeat of northeastern Mexico. But he spent a lot of time traversing these suburbs in rental cars. He went to the track in Los Alamitos for the races, the stud farm in Bonsall to buy breedings, private ranches, public auctions, and anywhere else he might find a quarter horse worth studying. This particular suburb was home to the Barretts auction house, where the final quarter-horse auction of 2008 was about to get started.<br><br>It was a small sale, 160 head, compared to 500 or even 1,000 at bigger auctions. Ramiro&#x2019;s particular interests made it feel even smaller. He bought mostly yearlings, one-year-old horses that would hit the tracks as two-year-olds the following year. He also bought weanlings, which hadn&#x2019;t yet turned one, as well as embryos and foals still in utero, bought on the strength of their genetics alone.<br><br>This sale would feature a mix of all kinds of quarter horses, including foals, weanlings, yearlings, stallions, and broodmares. Still, Ramiro had reason to be excited. The Schvaneveldt Winter Mixed Sale, as this auction was called, was run by the family of one of the sport&#x2019;s winningest trainers, Blane Schvaneveldt, and had attracted horses from the best bloodlines in the business. It was also a new venture, so attendance was sparse. That meant less competition on the way to the gavel.<br><br>Ramiro moved through the barns, peering through the metal bars of the stall doors. He made small talk in his choppy English with the other horsemen milling about&#x2014;trainers looking for their next champions, breeders hoping to make a big sale. They were some of the best in the business. Ramiro knew them all.<br><br>They knew him, too. They knew him by various nicknames, including &#x201c;the Horseman&#x201d; and &#x201c;Gordo,&#x201d; which they recognized as the Spanish word for &#x201c;fat.&#x201d; It made sense, given the way his cheeks and midsection curved like birthday balloons, pushing his five-foot-nine frame over 250 pounds. But at thirty-five years old, Ramiro was handsome, too, with eyes that played puppeteer to an electric smile, hair that crashed like a Malibu wave, and polo shirts in every color of Ralph Lauren&#x2019;s rainbow. He was a fresa&#x2014;a &#x201c;strawberry,&#x201d; a preppy&#x2014;through and through.<br><br>Most of the quarter-horse cowboys knew Gordo by his real name, Jos� Ramiro Villarreal Guajardo. Even if Ramiro didn&#x2019;t exactly fit in&#x2014;if his loafers seemed impractical, his polos a little bright for this hour, his double-fisted cellphones more than a little obnoxious&#x2014;Ramiro knew the sellers welcomed the sight of him. He could be a pain in their asses when it came time to collect, and the old cowboys occasionally had remind Ramiro just how Ford Tough they were. But Ramiro knew&#x2014;everyone knew&#x2014;that when the auctioneer started bellowing his gibberish, Ramiro was welcome here. Especially these days.<br><br>The Great Recession was grinding toward its thirteenth month. Home prices were in a free fall. A drought was ravaging Texas and other parts of the West, driving up hay prices. That meant the wealthy ranchers, oilmen, and businessmen who drove the quarter-horse industry were doing what wealthy people did in historic droughts and capital-R recessions: selling their planes and selling their horses. Sale prices were falling. A mixed sale like the Schvaneveldts&#x2019; averaged ten thousand dollars per horse in a good year; this year might only average six thousand.<br><br>That was bad news for the Schvaneveldts but good news for brokers like Ramiro. He was buying not for himself but for horsemen back in Mexico, who trusted him to pick out well-bred babies and haul them back across the border. He never said who his buyers were; they were &#x201c;Mexican businessmen&#x201d; and nothing more. He could safely assume that everyone in the barns knew what kind of business those Mexicans were in. But the industry didn&#x2019;t care, so long as Ramiro kept showing up to spend his clients&#x2019; money.<br><br>Ramiro kept coming, and the money kept coming&#x2014;eventually. Since Ramiro was a reliable big spender, the auction-house managers didn&#x2019;t demand that he settle up before he hauled his horses off to Mexico, as they might with lesser-known buyers. They let him take possession of the horses and then pestered him throughout the year to send the balance. So long as he zeroed out his account before the next auction, he remained a valued customer.<br><br>Recently, though, Ramiro&#x2019;s clients had been spending bigger and sending money less reliably. At a small sale in Dallas that summer, he&#x2019;d spent $112,000 on four yearlings, more money than any other buyer. In two auctions in Oklahoma that fall, he&#x2019;d spent $370,000 on twenty-eight horses&#x2014;and then promptly bounced ten checks worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. At one in New Mexico, he&#x2019;d spent $357,000 on eleven horses. And at another in California, he&#x2019;d spent $405,000 on seventeen horses. No other buyer came close to spending that much.<br><br>The checks eventually cleared; the wires eventually came through. But Ramiro was falling behind, despite spending hours on the phone, fielding and making phone calls in an effort to settle his debts. The industry was losing patience. Twice recently, sale managers had pushed Ramiro against auction-house walls, demanding he pay off the balance of his bills.<br><br>Yet when Ramiro&#x2019;s hand went up at the next auction, they never told him to lower it. They needed his clients&#x2019; money. Today especially. The crowd was thin, which meant sellers would either be giving deep discounts or buying back their horses and waiting for a new day. But Ramiro&#x2019;s Mexican clients seemed impervious to economic downturns. They wanted more horses, and the best horses, always.<br><br>Walking through the barns, Ramiro could get a sense of a horse&#x2019;s demeanor, its build, its balance, all data points that might influence how high he might be willing to bid. Sometimes he asked one of the handlers to heave open a stall&#x2019;s sliding door and walk the animal around, so he could see how the horse handled itself in space. But the real data was in the catalog he was holding. Each page was covered in size-nothing type detailing a single horse&#x2019;s lineage&#x2014;sire, dam, their sires and dams, and the career highlights of every horse along the line. Wins in &#x201c;stakes races&#x201d; were set in a heavier black font, which allowed seasoned buyers to assess the pedigree with a flip of the page. Their eyes were trained to scan for that coveted black type.<br><br>Like all buyers, Ramiro was especially interested in a horse&#x2019;s sire. Like all buyers, he was especially interested if that sire was First Down Dash. A champion racehorse in the 1980s, First Down Dash was the sport&#x2019;s most prolific breeder, responsible for hundreds of winners and millions in earnings.<br><br>The auction house offered two positions from which to bid. One was inside, in the small gallery that circled the sales ring. The other was outside, around the artificial-turf walking ring, where the horses were displayed before being led up a faux-brick walkway and inside. Ramiro liked it outside. There was a bid-spotter out there, looking for flying hands, and it was a good place to get one last glimpse of a horse before the bidding started. Ramiro found his post along the rail and struck his usual pose, his belly flung out in front of him and his sales book resting on top of it.</p><h2>Scientific Hat Finishing and Renovating (Classic Reprint)</h2><p>Excerpt from Scientific Hat Finishing and Renovating: A Complete and Profusely; Illustrated Course of Instruction, Enabling the Novice to Acquire the Art of Finishing and Remodeling Hats of All Varieties According to Tested and Approved Methods<br><br>In publishing this book it has been our aim to give to hat finishers and renovators a text book such as has heretofore been possessed by practically every craft but that of hatting.

But first she must convince the Cuthberts to let her stay, even though she isn&#x2019;t the boy they&#x2019;d hoped for. The loquacious Anne quickly finds her way into their hearts, as she has with generations of readers, and her charming, ingenious adventures in Avonlea, filled with colorful characters and tender escapades, linger forever in our memories. <br><br> This Modern Library edition of the first of L. M. Montgomery&#x2019;s beloved and immensely popular Avonlea novels features the restored original text.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

After introducing the reader to the development of the narrative structure of the book, the message (theology) is discussed in detail, with the aim of introducing the reader to the interrelatedness of the multiple theological ideas in this Gospel. Similarities, but also differences between the Gospel and Letters are constantly considered. Familiar with the content of the Gospel, readers are then confronted with questions about the origin, development and socio-cultural nature of the Gospel and letters. In each case the scholarly field is briefly reviewed and major solutions are discussed. Thorough discussions on different issues are presented in different chapters, each time referring to the relevant methodological approaches. How do the Gospel and Letters relate to the synoptics, or the Old Testament? Do we have a Gospel composed of multiple sources or is it a seamless document. How was this influential document written and where do the ideas found in the Gospel come from? </p><p>Since the aim of this book is to form a solid and comprehensive basis for future study of the Johannine literature, readers are placed firmly within the scholarly currents and streams of the Johannine literature. In terms of a metaphor: after reading the book, explorers will know what is out there and why. Now they can start to dig deeper for themselves without feeling lost in an uncharted land.</p></p><p>Jan van der Watt is Professor and head of the Department of New Testament Studies at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. His involvement with Johannine literature stretches over many years and includes publications like <i>"Family of the King. Dynamics of metaphor in the Gospel according to John"</i>. He was also co-chair of the Johannine seminar of the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas from 1997 to 2003. Currently he is area editor for Johannine literature and General Epistles for the 30 volume de Gruyter <i>Encyclopedia of the Bible and its Reception</i>, and is general editor of the <i>Review of Biblical Literature</i>. He is the author of over 80 academic articles, 25 chapters in books and 24 books.<strong> </strong>"Jan van der Watt has laboured long in the Johannine vineyard and his most recent book, 'An Introduction to the Johannine Gospel and Letters' shows the ripe fruit of that labour.Not only are the issues ofIntroduction addressed here but also various of the major theological, ethical and social issues are illuminated in this reader friendly study. Highly recommended." - Ben Witherington III, Asbury Theological Seminary, USA (Ben Witherington III)<br><br>"Jan van der Watt has provided us with a splendid textbook to the Gospel and the three letters of John. His book masterfully combines the quest of the historical origin of these New Testament writings, an exposition of their literary relationship and structure, and the theological analysis of the Johannine writings. The book has succeeded in conjoining two virtues which are often considered as being incompatible: It is written at the highest scholarly stage and it is easy to read. This makes the book important and useful not only for academic people &#x2014; experts and novices as well &#x2014;, but also for everybody who is interested in the history and theology of the most fascinating New Testament writings." - Michael Wolter, University of Bonn, Germany<br><br>"This fine introduction to the Gospel and the Letters of John results quite obviously from long years of hard labour that its author has invested in researching the Johannine writings. All the basic issues are covered: structure, content, source theories, composition history, social world, relationship to the Synoptics and the Old Testament, the link to Gnosticism, and so on. The often conflicting views of other prominent scholars are always presented in a very fair way. The author usually opts for more complex and balanced solutions, which I mostly share. A number of charts help the reader to get a firm grasp of the argument. Special features of the Gospel like irony and imagery are discussed, and a solid overview of its theology is given. This study is highly recommended as a textbook for classes on John. I am sure that the students will just love it." - Hans-Josef Klauck, Naomi Shenstone Donnelley Professor of New Testament and Early Christian Literature, The University of Chicago, Divinity School<br><br>Mention - <em>New Testament Abstracts</em>, Vol. 52 No. 3, 2008<br><br>"This is a crisp, succinct, and well-informed introduction to the Johannine literature..." -Donald Senior, C.P., <em>The Bible Today</em>, September 2008 (Donald Senior <i>The Bible Today</i>)<br><br>"Van der Watt succeeds in summarizing a great deal of material without bogging down in detail. He also shows a talent for explaining basic terms of biblical scholarship without disrupting the overall flow of the topic at hand. In short, the book is helpful in summarizing issues of Johannine scholarship while remaining accessible to those with no background in terminology or methodologies of biblical studies...Van der Watt demonstrates a gift for covering a lot of ground while illuminating that ground clearly, concisely, and engagingly. He also succeeds in showing how issues typically associated with scholarly study have an impact on practical issues of interpretation. Overall, this is an excellent introduction to Johannine studies for students or for congregational ministers seeking an acquaintance with the trends and overall sweep of Johannine scholarship." &#x2014;Milton Stanley, <em>Stone-Campbell Journal 11</em>, Fall 2008<br><br>"...this book abounds in insight and many helpful ways of putting things. It is sufficiently comprehensive that it surveys many positions from which van der Watt himself demurs, but sufficiently a reflection of van der Watt' own views that the book avoids the temptation to be ridiculously bland." (D. A. Carson <i>Rbl</i>)<br><br>"The author admirably fulfils his purpose of introducing students to the diverse ways of approaching these texts and of relating them to one another, thus bringing out their multifaceted nature. He employs a vivid style and incorporates helpful excurses and diagrams into his text to explain and illustrate particular points under discussion... In sum, we have here as useful and comprehensive an introduction to the subject, for teachers and students alike, as any encountered by me over many years of teaching in the field." <em>Journal for the Study of the New Testament Booklist 2009</em> (John Tudno Williams <i>Journal for the Study of the New Testament</i>)<br><br>'This would make a fine textbook or reference book for an introductory class on John at a seminary or within other academicenvironments. It would also make an excellent leader's reference for a pastoror other experienced lay reader teaching an adult class on John.' (<i>Trinity Seminary Review</i>)<br></p><h2>Knowing Otherwise: Race, Gender, and Implicit Understanding</h2><p><p>Prejudice is often not a conscious attitude: because of ingrained habits in relating to the world, one may act in prejudiced ways toward others without explicitly understanding the meaning of one&#x2019;s actions. Similarly, one may know how to do certain things, like ride a bicycle, without being able to articulate in words what that knowledge is. These are examples of what Alexis Shotwell discusses in <em>Knowing Otherwise</em> as phenomena of &#x201c;implicit understanding.&#x201d; Presenting a systematic analysis of this concept, she highlights how this kind of understanding may be used to ground positive political and social change, such as combating racism in its less overt and more deep-rooted forms. </p><p></p><p>Shotwell begins by distinguishing four basic types of implicit understanding: nonpropositional, skill-based, or practical knowledge; embodied knowledge; potentially propositional knowledge; and affective knowledge. She then develops the notion of a racialized and gendered &#x201c;common sense,&#x201d; drawing on Gramsci and critical race theorists, and clarifies the idea of embodied knowledge by showing how it operates in the realm of aesthetics. She also examines the role that both negative affects, like shame, and positive affects, like sympathy, can play in moving us away from racism and toward political solidarity and social justice. Finally, Shotwell looks at the politicized experience of one&#x2019;s body in feminist and transgender theories of liberation in order to elucidate the role of situated sensuous knowledge in bringing about social change and political transformation.</p></p><p><p>Alexis Shotwell is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Laurentian University in Ontario, Canada.</p>&#x201c;With its original interpretations of the importance of tacit knowledge to race and (trans)gender, <i>Knowing Otherwise</i> makes a significant contribution to social and political philosophy, epistemology, and especially feminist philosophy and critical philosophy of race. This book examines implicit knowledge to show how affective, emotional, and bodily understandings can contribute to political transformation. Shotwell convincingly demonstrates how the unspoken, and perhaps the unspeakable, frames the explicit knowledge that undergirds political activity.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Shannon Sullivan, The Pennsylvania State University<br><br>&#x201c;Exploring sensuous knowing that resists explicit formalization but is crucial to the possibility of a critical grasp of the world and the possibility of change, Alexis Shotwell investigates socially embedded, bodily, affective praxis that both registers and opens up truly &#x2018;knowing otherwise.&#x2019; Looking for sites of rupture of settled feeling and common sense, she explores the workings of shame that can move subjects beyond ineffective antiracist and antisexist guilt and asks how transformative social change may yet be possible. Her grasp of intersectional feminist philosophy, critical theory in the Marxist tradition, critical race theory, trans cultures and scholarship, philosophical approaches informed by Buddhist thought, and aesthetic theory after Kant is deep and creative.<i> Knowing Otherwise</i> is a wonderful, thoughtful, moving book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Donna Haraway, University of California, Santa Cruz<br><br>&#x201c;Alexis Shotwell&#x2019;s <i>Knowing Otherwise</i> draws on eclectic literatures and ideas across political theory, cultural studies, aesthetics, and feminist and critical race theory to expand our vision of epistemology. Outlining the various forms of nonpropositional knowledge, she takes up their possibilities for personal and political transformation. Many of us have long been dissatisfied with philosophy&#x2019;s emphasis on the spoken word but lacked a framework for grasping how extralinguistic knowledge can really be understood&#x2014;and especially for grasping its political import. Shotwell fills this gap.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a courageous and ambitious book, and anyone who can meaningfully connect the likes of John Searle and Michael Polanyi with Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Audre Lorde, and Avery Gordon deserves to be named Young Philosopher of the Year. The writing is clear as a bell, while the argument is profoundly heterodox and original. Shotwell shatters conventional thinking about forms of knowledge without sacrificing nuance and while remaining true to her radical political intuitions. This is honest and attentive philosophy, rich at the level of example and responsible to political practice.

He is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Blind Ambition</i>, <i>Broken Government</i>, <i>Conservatives Without Conscience</i>, and <i>Worse Than Watergate</i>.<p>On June 20 President Nixon&#x2019;s day began as did most throughout his presidency. He had breakfast in the residence, on this morning at 8:40 A.M., where he scanned&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>, both of which had front-page headlines on the Watergate incident: The&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&#x2019;s was EX-G.O.P. AIDE LINKED TO POLITICAL RAID, by Tad Szulc, and the&nbsp;<i>Post</i>&nbsp;had WHITE HOUSE CONSULTANT TIED TO BUGGING FIGURE, by Bob Woodward and E. J. Bachinski. Both reported Hunt&#x2019;s connection to the break-in, the&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&nbsp;connecting him through his ties with the Miami Cubans and the&nbsp;<i>Post</i>&nbsp;reporting that Hunt&#x2019;s name and White House phone number had been found in the address books of two of the arrested men. Both stories reported that Hunt had been a consultant to Chuck Colson and that White House spokesman Ron Ziegler had said from Florida that he would not comment on &#x201c;a third-rate burglary attempt.&#x201d; But Ken Clawson, a former&nbsp;<i>Washington Post</i>&nbsp;reporter who now worked for Colson, told the&nbsp;<i>Post</i>&nbsp;that Hunt had left the White House and Colson had no knowledge of his Watergate-related activities. The&nbsp;<i>Post</i>&nbsp;account also noted that Larry O&#x2019;Brien said the Democrats were considering a lawsuit.<br><br> When the president arrived in the Oval Office at 9:00 A.M., he signed a few documents and then scanned his news summary, a document prepared every weekday by White House aides containing highlights of the coverage of the Nixon administration by network television news, wire services and newsmagazines, with occasional special issues on media coverage of issues of interest to the president, who was not a television viewer. The document summarized a vast amount of information from the preceding twenty-four-hour news cycle (or for forty-eight hours over weekends) and served as both an information and a management tool. When the president finished reading it, the staff secretary reviewed his marginal notes and directives and prepared an &#x201c;administratively confidential&#x201d; memorandum to inform various staffers of the president&#x2019;s requests or directives. Because the summary could become voluminous, Haldeman often reviewed it beforehand, underlining with a blue felt-tipped pen the material that he thought might be of particular interest to Nixon.<br><br> Watergate was a lead item in that day&#x2019;s summary (with Haldeman&#x2019;s underlining reproduced here): &#x201c;3-4 minutes on all nets on what [NBC&#x2019;s John] Chancellor called &#x2018;1 of the most fascinating and exotic stories ever out of DC.&#x2019; The GOP, said Chancellor, is &#x2018;scandalized and fit to be tied.&#x2019; McG[overn] and [the Republican National Committee chairman, Senator Robert] Dole on all nets; O&#x2019;Brien on 2 shows w/HHH [former vice president and again senator Hubert Humphrey (D-MN)] and [Senator Edmund] Muskie [D-ME] getting in their licks as well on CBS. Dems will file a court suit Tues.&#x201d;<br><br> On page 16, under the heading POLITICS and the subheading &#x201c;DNC Break-In,&#x201d; the following item caught the president&#x2019;s attention: &#x201c;On CBS Hubert Humphrey said RN and cabinet &#x2018;owed country an apology and explanation for this incredible act&#x2019; although he had no evidence GOP behind the incident. Humphrey acknowledged such things can happen in US politics, he discounted a Democratic investigation because it would be politically motivated and said the Department of Justice would have to be trusted.&#x201d;<br><br> After reading this, the president wrote questions for White House aide Pat Buchanan: &#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t there been some other break-ins in political and government offices? Where were the cries of anguish when the [<i>New York</i>]&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&nbsp;and [Jack] Anderson got [Pulitzer] prizes for publicizing stolen top-secret government documents [referring to the Pentagon Papers]?&#x201d;<br><br> As Nixon was reading the summary, Bob Haldeman and John Mitchell were joining John Ehrlichman in his office, on the second floor of the West Wing, directly over the Oval Office. I was asked to join this meeting, which was in progress when I arrived. I was told that Attorney General Richard Kleindienst was in the West Wing lobby and would soon be joining us.1 Kleindienst would later adamantly claim that he had never attended this meeting, and Mitchell, Haldeman and Ehrlichman would later claim that they could not recall what had transpired during the forty-five minutes before I arrived, although they did not dispute my recollections, or that Kleindienst had attended as well. As I later summarized:<br><br> I expected some weighty decisions to be made in this company. Wrong. All parties were guarded. The White House faction did not trust the Justice Department faction, and, moreover, no one wanted to acknowledge how serious the problem might be.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ehrlichman raised the only matters of substance, and even they were marginal. He told Mitchell that the White House would steer all Watergate press inquiries to the Re-election Committee. Mitchell nodded, not happy, not objecting. Then Ehrlichman asked Kleindienst about the Watergate leaks. Kleindienst replied that they were coming from the Metropolitan Police. He said the problem would soon be solved, since the FBI was assuming jurisdiction over the investigation.2<br><br> Haldeman, however, did record in his diary that evening: &#x201c;I had a long meeting with Ehrlichman and Mitchell. We added Kleindienst for a little while and John Dean for quite a while. The conclusion was that we&#x2019;ve got to hope the FBI doesn&#x2019;t go beyond what&#x2019;s necessary in developing evidence and that we can keep a lid on that, as well as keeping all the characters involved from getting carried away with any unnecessary testimony.&#x201d;3<br><br> Ehrlichman went from our meeting to the president&#x2019;s EOB office, where they talked from 10:25 until 11:20 A.M. Honoring the president&#x2019;s request, Ehrlichman did not mention Watergate, but just as they were parting, the president made the point to Ehrlichman that he had noted on his news summary that the press was all excited about the Watergate break-in but that they passed out Pulitzer Prizes to the&nbsp;<i>Times</i>&nbsp;and Anderson for stealing documents.4 He would repeat that complaint in later conversations throughout the day.<br><br> After Ehrlichman departed the EOB office, the president ordered a bowl of soup for lunch and complained to a Secret Service agent about the dictating equipment he had used in the Bahamas and on Air Force One over the weekend. From 11:26 A.M. until 12:45 P.M. the president met with Haldeman.5 While Watergate was not the focus of their discussion, the subject did arise in passing early on and again at the end. But this June 20, 1972, conversation lives in infamy because when the recording of it was later subpoenaed by the Watergate special prosecutor, it contained an 18�-minute gap consisting of a buzzing sound that experts determined had been caused by five to nine deliberate erasures of the tape. This gap created a media frenzy when it was revealed, and it was the basis for a mystery that has lasted to this day.*<br><br> The conversation began with talk of the good weather they had left behind in Florida, followed by a discussion of the president&#x2019;s schedule. Because Nixon expected poor weather in July, when they were to be in California, he told Haldeman he would return to the Bahamas in August. After going over routine matters, Haldeman mentioned that the Republican governor of South Dakota was having some political trouble, and the president began to dictate the outline of a letter. South Dakota was, of course, the home base of his likely reelection opponent, Senator George McGovern. It was while discussing this letter to the governor, some seven minutes into the conversation, that the 18�-minute buzzing begins.<br><br> The fact that they next spoke about Watergate can be determined by notes Haldeman made during the meeting; read as a record of the meeting they do not reveal anything of particular importance.6 Haldeman&#x2019;s note-taking procedures have been misunderstood; he did not make a record of or even cite the highlights of what was said at any given session but instead recorded only matters that called for further attention and follow-up. It was in his diary he made an effort to record the actual gist of meetings and events, or of matters he thought of importance on any given day. Haldeman made his diary entries at the end of each day with uncanny discipline and regularity, and given the often highly incriminating information they contain, it does not appear he filtered information if he remembered it. Accordingly, Haldeman&#x2019;s diary entry is often more revealing but adds little to his notes for June 20, 1972.<br><br> Per Haldeman&#x2019;s notes (which I have translated from his abbreviated shorthand7), the following Watergate matters were raised during that morning&#x2019;s meeting: The president instructed Haldeman to be sure his EOB office was thoroughly checked for bugs at all times. He wanted to know what the White House &#x201c;counter-attack&#x201d; to Watergate would be. He wanted to launch a public relations offensive that would undermine Watergate by charging his opponents with their own questionable activities. Nixon had always been annoyed by the well-known fact that Jack Anderson had gotten away with bugging (and at the time of Watergate there was a rumor that McGovern&#x2019;s staff had tried to bug Nixon&#x2019;s reelection committee). The president wanted to point out that libertarians had created a callous public attitude toward bugging and wiretapping, and &#x201c;the public didn&#x2019;t give a shit about it.&#x201d; Finally, he repeated to Haldeman the complaint that his detractors were making a big deal out of stealing information from the DNC while justifying the theft of the Pentagon Papers and Anderson&#x2019;s publishing of national security secrets. He told Haldeman that they &#x201c;should be on the attack&#x201d; regarding Watergate, if for no other reason than diversion. The 18�-minute gap also covered material unrelated to Watergate, according to Haldeman&#x2019;s notes, for the president asked him to find out the schedule of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreement, and they discussed details of an upcoming trip to California.<br><br> After listening to countless hours of Nixon&#x2019;s conversation, I can confirm what he wrote in his memoir about the gap in the June 20 conversation: &#x201c;It has always been my habit to discuss problems a number of times, often in almost the same terms and usually with the same people. This is the way I tried to elicit every possible piece of information and advice and examine every possible angle of a situation before making this decision.&#x201d;8<br><br> I would add that Nixon also had the habit of ending a discussion by going over key points he had made during it, and that appears to have been the case for this June 20 conversation. At its conclusion he returns to the subject of Watergate, as Haldeman&#x2019;s notes recorded, but in a slightly different form: &#x201c;If I can come back on this thing more intently, I can be very, very serious on the hypocrisy. There&#x2019;s no question there&#x2019;s a double standard here.&#x201d; Haldeman agreed and made an inaudible counterpoint, which Nixon dismissed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a shit about that. Also regarding political money, and contributions, too. They&#x2019;re all doing it. That&#x2019;s the standard thing. Why the Christ do we have to hire people to sweep our rooms?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Because we know they&#x2019;re&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> Nixon finished Haldeman&#x2019;s sentence, &#x201c;Yeah, they&#x2019;re bugging. And why&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sue &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Haldeman quietly interjected, as the president was making his point.<br> &#x201c;We have been bugged in the past, haven&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br><br> With this question the recording ends abruptly, and it is followed by 2 minutes and 53 seconds of a specific tone added throughout the recordings by NARA to indicate that personal material was withdrawn. The NARA Tape Subject Log for this conversation (No. 342-16), prepared by people who listened to this redacted portion, indicates that Nixon&#x2019;s rhetorical question referred to his &#x201c;previous campaigns&#x201d;&#x2014;namely, the 1968 presidential campaign. Nixon raised this particular topic throughout Watergate, believing that if he could make an issue of what had been done to him, it would place the DNC break-in in context.<br><br> Haldeman&#x2019;s diary entry about this June 20 conversation is consistent with Nixon&#x2019;s account of it in his memoir (which undoubtedly his postpresidency staff checked) concerning the information missing in the 18�-minute gap: &#x201c;The P was concerned about what our counterattack is, our PR offensive to top this. He felt we have to hit the opposition with their activities. Also put out the point that the libertarians have created public callousness. Do they justify this kind of thing less than stealing the Pentagon papers, or Anderson&#x2019;s files, and so on. He feels we should be on the attack for diversion, and not just take it lying down.&#x201d;<br><br> Nixon further explained in his memoir: &#x201c;I am confident that our discussion about the break-in covered much the same points at 11:26 in the morning as it did just five hours later at 4:35 in the afternoon: that if any of our people, at any level, had embroiled us in such an embarrassing situation; and that the investigations and depositions, if they went too far in pursuing all angles available, would hand the Democrats a major campaign issue.&#x201d;9 Haldeman&#x2019;s diary confirmed that Nixon raised the subject again several times during the day, &#x201c;and it is obviously bothering him. He had Colson over to talk about it, and then later called me a couple times on various specifics. He called me at home tonight, saying he wanted to change the plans for his press conference and have it on Thursday instead of tomorrow, so it won&#x2019;t look like he&#x2019;s reacting to the Democratic break-in thing.&#x201d;10<br><br> At 2:16 P.M. Nixon called Colson, whose office was right beside his in the EOB, and asked him to come over. They met from 2:20 P.M. to 3:30 P.M.11 Watergate was discussed for approximately twelve minutes at the outset, and then fleetingly at the end. The president tried to boost Colson&#x2019;s spirits&#x2014;he was already being implicated in Watergate by news accounts&#x2014;while sharing his thoughts about how the White House should deal with the problem.<br><br> &#x201c;Now, I hope everybody is not going to get into a tizzy about the Democratic Committee,&#x201d; Nixon said, sounding as if he is stretched out in his favorite easy chair, beside his desk.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little frustrating. Disheartening, I guess, is the right word,&#x201d; Colson replied, with something of a pained tone, adding, &#x201c;Pick up that God damn&nbsp;<i>Washington Post</i>. See you&#x2019;re guilty by association.&#x201d; Colson was annoyed about the story linking him to the Watergate break-in because Hunt had worked for him, although he had been off the White House payroll for three months.<br><br> The president listened to Colson complain about how his family wondered if he had been involved but dismissed such speculation, because Nixon said he would not have someone that careless on his White House staff; &#x201c;A lot of people think you ought to wiretap. Or knew why the hell we&#x2019;re doing it. They probably figure they&#x2019;re doing it to us.&#x201d; Then Nixon added, &#x201c;Which they are.&#x201d; When Colson concurred, the president asked, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why they hired this guy [McCord] in the first place, to sweep the rooms, didn&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, sir. Frankly, sir, I haven&#x2019;t gotten ...</p></p><h2>Uncovering the Truth About Meriwether Lewis</h2><p>The critically acclaimed biography Meriwether Lewis, coauthored by Thomas C. Danisi, was praised for its meticulous research and for shedding new light on the adventurous life and controversial death of the great explorer who became famous through the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Now, the author, with some help from contributors, extends his groundbreaking studies of Meriwether Lewis with this compilation of historical essays that offers new findings based on recently discovered docu�ments, tackling such intriguing subjects as:-The court-martial of Meriwether Lewis: Danisi&#39;s discovery of the astonishing never-before published transcript of the entire court-martial proceedings affords him the distinction of being the first historian to mine the document for the many insights it offers into the then-untested twenty-one-year-old officer, who eloquently defended himself and won his case.-Documentation straight from the medical ledgers of Dr. Antoine Saugrain, the physician who treated Governor Lewis, which helps to confirm that Lewis suffered from malaria prior to his celebrated trek to the Pacific Ocean with the Corps of Discovery and continuing through his service as governor of the Louisiana Ter�ritory. Was Lewis&#39;s death, as reported, the result of suicide, or was he merely a victim of this episodic and incurable disease?-Documentation that proves the true nature of the much-discussed Gilbert Russell State�ment given at the court-martial of General James Wilkinson. Some historians have argued that Wilkinson orchestrated Lewis&#39;s murder, but Danisi&#39;s research sets the record straight.-The role of Major James Neelly in Lewis&#39;s last days. This subject has gained much prominence through the History Channel, according to which Neelly supposedly lied to President Thomas Jefferson about his presence at Meriwether Lewis&#39;s burial, but Danisi has evidence to the contrary. The author presents an abundance of additional material to fill in previous historical gaps regarding the mysteries and controversies surrounding Lewis&#39;s life and death. In doing so, he paints a vivid picture of the brilliant rise of an ambitious young man by virtue of courage, talent, and political connections, and the tragic fall of a conscientious public servant under the weight of chronic illness, bureaucratic pettiness, and the political intrigue that was ram�pant throughout America&#39;s Wild West.This superb contribution to Meriwether Lewis research is a must-read for students and scholars of American history and anyone with an interest in one of our nation&#39;s most important explorers and public servants.</p><p><b>Thomas C.

Scholars have long believed that &#x2018;the truth&#x2019; or a logical explanation could never be known; otherwise it would have surfaced as a result of the extensive research that preceded the bicentennial of the expedition.

Prior to Danisi&#x2019;s work, historians attributed Lewis&#x2019;s death to suicide as a result of lifelong depression, but Danisi hypothesized that the explorer&#x2019;s untimely death was brought on by &#x2018;the ague&#x2019; or malaria. In Uncovering the Truth about Meriwether Lewis, Danisi delivers the proof. The scholarship is backed with additional new evidence and supported with never-before published documentation.

The poet traces the rich voice of identity through the turbulent passions of childhood and adolescence and their casually spoken, pungent lines that don&#x2019;t ever go away. Here, amid the myriad complications of the first phase of life, addiction and incarceration of relatives are but details, not destinies. These starkly succinct poems and prose poems map a powerful constellation of becoming.

The poems are ethereally beautiful&#x2015;razor-sharp and dreamlike at once&#x2015;as they explore the heavy realities and expectations of family, poverty, drugs, crime, and sexual exploitation. The poems gallop off from there, each title blooming into a memory, a whisper, a haunting&#x2015;a horse in the night, flashing by lightning-fast.

In one poem, the speaker wants to &#x2018;understand why the light in my dad&#x2019;s body / after the needle&#x2019;s tucked in is orange / on a river so silver I can barely see him.&#x2019; In another poem that seeks to decipher her family&#x2019;s troubled legend, the speaker considers the role her mother plays: &#x2018;Maybe Mom&#x2019;s the horse / because aren&#x2019;t horses beautiful, / can&#x2019;t they kill a man if spooked?&#x2019; A quiet sensuality underscores the domestic unrest, and Delgado&#x2019;s understated lyrics read like snippets from a private conversation with an unknown interlocutor, one who shares her intimacy with both sides of the law: &#x2018;California has a lot of prisons, all with beautiful names.&#x2019; An introspective carousel of electric, lightning lyrics.&#x201d;<br> <b>&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></b></p></p><h2>The Secret Sister: A thrilling family saga (Fairham Island, 1)</h2><p><b>Did she once have a sister? Has her mother lied all these years?&nbsp;</b><br><br>After a painful divorce, Maisey Lazarow returns to Fairham, the small island off the South Carolina coast where she grew up. She goes there to heal&#x2014;and to help her brother, Keith, a deeply troubled man who's asked her to come home. But she refuses to stay in the family house. The last person she wants to see is the wealthy, controlling mother she escaped years ago.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead, she finds herself living next door to someone else she'd prefer to avoid&#x2014;Rafe Romero, the wild, reckless boy to whom she lost her virginity at sixteen. He's back on the island, and to her surprise, he's raising a young daughter alone. Maisey's still attracted to him, but her heart's too broken to risk...&nbsp;<br><br>Then something even more disturbing happens. She discovers a box of photographs that evoke distant memories of a little girl, a child Keith remembers, too. Maisey believes the girl must've been their sister, but their mother claims there was no sister.&nbsp;<br><br>Maisey is convinced that child existed. So where is she now?</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Brenda Novak has written over 60 novels.

She considers herself lucky to be a mother of five and married to the love of her life.&nbsp;www.brendanovak.com <br>MAISEY LAZAROW'S BROTHER met her at the ferryalone. Part of her, a big part, was grateful her mother wasn't with him. Even after ten years, Maisey wasn't ready to confront the autocratic and all-powerful "queen" of Fairham, South Carolina. The fact that Josephine hadn't deigned to come with Keith made it clear Maisey would not be easily forgiven. Only after her mother had punished her sufficiently would she be welcomed back into Josephine's good graces.<br><br>Although Maisey had expected as much, coming up against that reality nearly made her balk. What was she doing here? She'd sworn she'd never return to the small island where she'd been raised, that she'd never again subject herself to Josephine's manipulation and control.<br><br>But that was before, when she'd set off to build her shiny new life. And this was now, when that shiny new life had imploded on her. She was coming back to Fairham because her brother needed her but, truth be told, she needed Keith, too.<br><br>At least her mother wasn't currently married. The men Josephine chose were almost as bad as she was, just in different ways.<br><br>What Maisey needed most was her father, she realized as she stood at the railing, peering through the passengers crowding the gangway. Breathing in the island air, smelling the salty ocean and wet wood of the wharf, it all reminded her of him. But Malcolm had died in a boating accident when she was ten. That was when her mother had grown even more overbearing. Without Malcolm, there was no one to soften Josephine's sharper edges, no one to hold her in check. Not that the buffer he'd provided was the only reason, or even the primary reason, she missed him...<br><br>"There you are!" Keith called across the distance, waving to make sure he had her attention.<br><br>Grabbing the handles of her two suitcases, which contained everything she hadn't shipped to the island in boxes, she stepped into the flow of people so she could disembark. It was too late to change her mind about moving home. She'd given up her apartment in Manhattan and depleted most of her savings, thanks to the exorbitant fees of the divorce attorney she'd had to hire.<br><br>"You look great," Keith told her as she moved closer.<br><br>Maisey conjured up her best approximation of a smile&#x2014;she seemed unable to smile spontaneously these days&#x2014;and embraced him. "Thanks." She was wearing an expensive white tunic with Jimmy Choo shoes and Chanel jewelry, but she'd never looked worse and she knew it. She hadn't been sleeping or eating well&#x2014;not since <em>that</em> day two years ago, the worst day of her life. It didn't help that her brother was also going through a difficult time. Once she'd learned about his suicide attempt, she'd been so manic about selling her furniture and what she could sacrifice of her other belongings so she could return to Fairham to be with him that she hadn't bothered to do much shopping or cooking, which had caused her to lose even more weight. Her color wasn't good, either.<br><br>But her brother didn't look much better. Nearly six-foot-six with a set of broad shoulders that gave him a nice frame, he could stand to gain some weight, too. And he had dark circles under his eyes&#x2014;the same blue-green eyes she possessed that always drew so much attention.<br><br>"You look good, too," she lied, and suppressed a wry chuckle. She was home, all right. The pretense was already starting. Her ex-husband's frank honesty was one of the things that had attracted her to him, which made his actions at the end of their marriage seem especially ironic.<br><br>"How was your trip?" Keith pulled her thoughts away from the past, where they resided far too frequently.<br><br>"Not bad," she replied. No way did she want to regale him with stories of how difficult she found it just to walk out of her apartment building. She'd spent weeks at a time holed up in bed, but he didn't need to know that only the urgency of his situation had been sufficient motivation to get her on her feet again. "How's Mom?"<br><br>He shot her a look that acknowledged the tension any reference to Josephine created. "The same. She might not act like it, but she's excited to have you home. She's had a room in the east wing prepared for you."<br><br>The <em>guest</em> wing? The significance of that didn't escape Maisey. If there'd been any doubt that she was to be treated with cool disdain until she'd done her penance, this proved it.<br><br>The anger that flared up, making her stiffen, surprised Maisey. Apparently she wasn't <em>completely</em> cowed and broken. The idea of walking into Coldiron House&#x2014;named after Josephine's father, Henry Coldiron, who'd owned most of the island before Josephine inherited it&#x2014;brought back a hint of her old defiance. She couldn't cope with living there, couldn't submit, as she would have to submit, in order to regain her mother's approval.<br><br>"I won't be staying at Mom's," she said.<br><br>Keith had started to reach for her suitcases. At this, he straightened. "What do you mean?"<br><br>"I mean I have to find somewhere else."<br><br>He measured her with his eyes, and she found them so hollow she grew frightened for him all over again. Was he doing as well as he claimed? He didn't seem to be particularly robust&#x2014;in body or spirit.<br><br>"I understand it'll be a bit uncomfortable for you at first." He glanced away as if he could tell she was trying to see behind the front he was putting on. "But trust me. Mom will come around. You'll piss her off if you don't stay at the house, and that'll only make matters worse. After a few weeks..."<br><br>"No." She broke in before he could get any further into his appeal. "I can't do it."<br><br>He stared at her. "You're serious. You've barely arrived, and you're going to make her angry? She has too much pride to put up with the rejection."<br><br>"She rejected me first. And I don't have a relationship with her, anyway," Maisey said. "We communicate through email or her housekeeper, for crying out loud. I've spoken to her only a handful of times over the past decade." And when they <em>had</em> talked, there'd been more silence than anything. There'd even been silence when Maisey had desperately craved consolation.<br><br>"You need her," he said. "We both do. And that means we'll always be under her thumb."<br><br>Although she was secretly frightened that might be true, Maisey scoffed at it. "No. I'll help you, stand by you. I just need to...to get back on my feet, and she can only hurt my ability to do that." The thought of walking through those heavy doors, dragging her belongings behind her, almost gave her a panic attack. At least, if she didn't stay at Coldiron House, she'd retain some autonomy, some independence. She had to protect the little peace of mind she had left.<br><br>He rubbed his gaunt face. "So where will you stay?"<br><br>"I could rent a room from someone in town." She had enough money for that, didn't she? Her reserves would last six months or so.<br><br>"Here on Fairham?" Her brother shook his head, adamant. "That would provoke an all-out war."<br><br>He was right. To maintain <em>some</em> semblance of peace, she couldn't cross certain lines. She couldn't embarrass her mother by revealing that there was any strain inside the family. Appearances were everything to Josephine. They were Coldirons, even though their surname was technically Lazarow, and they needed to comport themselves as such.<br><br>How many times had she heard <em>that</em> lecture?<br><br>"What if I got an apartment in Charleston?" she asked, but decided against it almost as soon as the words passed her lips. Charleston would cost too much and, left on her own, she wouldn't recover. Being sequestered in a cheap, unfamiliar apartment would be worse than living alone in New York with the furniture Jack hadn't taken.<br><br>"I don't see." he started, but she cut him off again.<br><br>"Wait." The solution had occurred to her, and it was so obvious she couldn't believe she hadn't thought of it before. "Why couldn't I stay in one of the bungalows?"<br><br>"The <em>vacation rentals?</em> They're on the far side of the island!"<br><br>"So?" Going back and forth to Coldiron House wouldn't require a ferry, like it would from Charleston. And it was September, when the small influx of vacationers who visited Fairham each summer returned to their regular lives. <em>One</em> of the nine units should be available. "We're talking ten miles if I take the bike path. I'll buy a bike and ride over whenever you want me to. Or you can come hang out at my place."<br><br>Maisey felt that would be even better. Not only would living in Smuggler's Cove enable her to avoid their mother, it would provide <em>Keith</em> a place to go occasionally, a place where he wouldn't have to deal with Josephine&#x2014;meaning he wouldn't have to resort to drugs as his escape.<br><br>"Most of them haven't been refurbished since Hurricane Lorna last fall," he said.<br><br>"I could've sworn you told me months ago that Mom was hiring a contractor." That was well before Keith's last big blowup with Josephine, when he'd stormed off to "live his own life." He'd disappeared for several months before ending up on another drug binge, which had culminated in the black moment that had brought him home again&#x2014;the same black moment that had ultimately brought her home, too.<br><br>"She <em>has</em> hired a contractor," he said, "but she didn't get around to it until I got back a couple of weeks ago. Construction's just begun."<br><br>Her mother had waited a <em>year</em> to rebuild? "Why'd she wait so long?"<br><br>He took her suitcase, and walked toward the sleek gray Mercedes he'd parked in the lot. It was their mother's car. He no longer owned anything to speak of. Although he'd turned thirty-six in February, an age by which most people had managed to accumulate a vehicle and some furniture or other personal property, he'd sold everything for drug money. What he hadn't sold, he'd given away while he was high or destroyed out of anger and frustration.<br><br>"She was in another relationship with some off-islander, so she couldn't be bothered," he said in response to her question.<br><br>"But I'm sure she'll tell you the delay was all my fault. As you know, I haven't made things easy on her&#x2014;or anyone else."<br><br>Including himself... Keith had caused nothing but heartache. But it disturbed Maisey that her mother always had to assign blame. "The future doesn't have to be a reflection of the past." She touched his arm for encouragement. "We'll get through the coming months together. It'll be okay now that we have each other."<br><br>When he didn't respond, Maisey wished she hadn't questioned him about the delay in construction, hadn't made him accept responsibility for it. He needed to look ahead&#x2014;not behind. "I'm sure the bungalows will be ready by next summer, which means we only missed one tourist season."<br><br>He was putting her suitcases in the trunk, so she couldn't read his expression. "That's the goal," he said.<br><br>"Have you been out to see them recently?" she asked as they slid into the sun-warmed interior of the Mercedes and buckled their seat belts.<br><br>"Mom's sent me over once or twice, yeah."<br><br>"How bad are they?"<br><br>"Pretty bad."<br><br>She cringed. <em>"Structurally?"</em><br><br>"Units 1 to 4 need structural repairs."<br><br>"What about 5 to 9?" They were set back off the beach, in the trees. Maisey assumed the wind hadn't hit them as hard.<br><br>"They're sound, but they still need a lot of work."<br><br>Maisey hated that the bungalows had been damaged. Since the eighties, when her father'd had them built, Smuggler's Cove had been a magical place for her, a place where she could find him, or some essence of him, even after he was gone. She had so many fond memories of tagging along to the rentals that, when he died, she'd wanted to scatter his ashes there on the beach. But her mother retained control of his remains, like she did everything else. His ashes were kept in a decorative urn on the mantel of the formal living room at Coldiron House. Not for any sentimental reason. But because it allowed Josephine to pretend he was her one great love, since she hadn't been able to get along with anyone else&#x2014;not for long, anyway. Every other relationship had fallen apart within two or three years.<br><br>"I don't mind helping with the cleanup and repairs, maybe doing some painting, that sort of thing." There was a period when she and Jack, her ex-husband, had watched almost every do-it-yourself show on TV, and used much of what they'd learned to improve their small cabin in the Catskill Mountains. It had been sold, as stipulated by the divorce decree, but she'd always loved it there.<br><br>Keith backed out of the parking space. "I'm not sure the contractor's going to like having you in the middle of everything."<br><br>"I'll stay out of his way." She tucked her dark hair behind her ears. It was getting too long; she needed to have it trimmed. "Who'd Mom hire? Anyone from around here?"<br><br>"Raphael Something. Can't remember his last name. I didn't ask where he was from. I know he's done other work on the island, though, because I've seen his sign&#x2014;High Tide Construction."<br><br>Maisey had never met anyone by that name or heard of the company. But then, plenty could've changed since she'd been gone. "Can we go to Smuggler's Cove now, see if it's even a possibility?"<br><br>He hit the brake, stopping before they could exit the lot. "You're not thinking of moving in without asking Mom..."<br><br>Knowing that she had a viable alternative&#x2014;if she <em>did</em> have one&#x2014;would help her get through that daunting first encounter. "I can't imagine she'd refuse to let me live in one of Dad's bungalows. He'd turn over in his grave if she did." They were something her father had created and paid for with the money <em>he'd</em> brought into the relationship. "Besides, I'm supposed to inherit the development, remember?" <em>"If</em> she follows his wishes."<br><br>Maisey had to acknowledge that the future of the cottages rested in her mother's hands, since Josephine had inherited them first. "Well, you've heard the clich�&#x2014;it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission."<br><br>He pursed his lips. "Not with her."<br><br>The complexity of Keith's relationship with Josephine accounted for a lot of his problems. Maisey wished he could get out on his own so he wouldn't need Josephine's help. Then he could also reject her advice and any unwanted intrusions into his life. But, so far, that hadn't happened; he and Josephine were mutually dependent on each other. She provided financial support, and since she couldn't be satisfied with any of her romances, he gave her companionship&#x2014;when he wasn't acting out. They loved each other but hated each other, too. But because Maisey was coming home with almost nothing, she wasn't exactly the perfect example of how to get away, so she hesitated to say too much.<br><br>"Come on, I'm on her shit list, anyway," she said, pretending more indifference than she felt.<br><br>He released a sigh. "Fine. Then why not really piss her off, huh?"<br><br></p><h2>Bridges To People</h2><p>Bridges to People is designed and written as a practical tool for Christian people and Christian ministry leaders desiring to accomplish effective ministry among the present global culturally diverse society existing in North America and throughout the world.

Yet membership by blacks in the Episcopal Church has always been viewed as an anomaly. In a nation in which 80 percent of the black Christian population belong to black denominations, it has seemed incongruous to many that the descendants of slaves and the descendants of slaveholders could together find a spiritual home in the Episcopal Church. Moreover, the mode of religious expression of Anglicanism has been seen as incompatible with the black religious ethos.Attempts to explain this phenomenon frequently dismiss black Episcopalians as social climbers, and their authenticity as African Americans, and even as Christians, is called into question. Yet With a Steady Best, however, argues that blacks have remained in the Episcopal Church because they have recognized it as catholic and therefore inclusive institution. For two hundred years blacks have challenged the church to be true to its catholic claims and have used this principle as a basis for their demands for recognition. This book chronicles the &#x201c;steady beat&#x201d; of that challenge.Harold T.

Although Missouri was allowed to join the union with slavery, the compromise in fact closed off nearly all remaining federal territories to slavery. <br><br>When Congressman James Tallmadge of New York proposed barring slavery from the new state of Missouri, he sparked the most candid discussion of slavery ever held in Congress. The southern response quenched the surge of nationalism and confidence following the War of 1812 and inaugurated a new politics of racism and reaction. The South's rigidity on slavery made it an alluring electoral target for master political strategist Martin Van Buren, who emerged as the key architect of a new Democratic Party explicitly designed to mobilize southern unity and neutralize antislavery sentiment.

From the warrior queens of the sixth century b.c. to the female shipowners influential in opening the Northwest Passage, <i>She Captains</i> brings together a real-life cast of characters whose audacity and bravado will capture the imagination. In her inimitable style, Joan Druett paints a vivid portrait of real women who were drawn to the ocean's beauty -- and danger -- and dared to captain ships of their own.</p><p>Mention the word "pirate," and you'll likely conjure up an image, courtesy of Robert Newton's scenery-chewing performance in the 1950 film adaptation of <i>Treasure Island</i>, that features a peg-leg, a parrot, and a mighty "arrrgh."<p> New Zealand-based maritime historian Joan Druett amends that image to include voices in a higher register, adding <i>She Captains</i> to other works (<i>Hen Frigates</i>, <i>"She Was a Sister Sailor"</i>) that address women's roles in the passage and exploration of the high seas. Druett reaches far back in history, opening her lively book with an account of the water-coursing Massegetae queen Tomyris, who bested the Persian king Cyrus on the shores of the Volga River. Druett enlists dozens of other militarily, criminally, and commercially extraordinary women in her dramatis personae, including the Egyptian pharaoh Cleopatra, whose name is synonymous with mysterious beauty but who also commanded a mighty navy; Cheng I Sao, the 18th-century terror of the South China Sea; and Lucy Brewer, who, disguised as a man, served as a common sailor aboard the U.S.S. <i>Constitution</i>. Along the way Druett considers the role of New England women as financial mainstays of the whaling trade, stops at Spanish ports of call controlled by powerful (and sometimes bloodthirsty) women, and generally has a fine time exploring waters that history has little charted. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Joan Druett,</b> an award-winning writer of nautical nonfiction, is the author of numerous works, including <i>Hen Frigates</i> and <i>In the Wake of Madness.</i> She lives in New Zealand.

Written in clear prose, this book will be of relevance to scholar and practitioner alike."<br>--<b>Sean Adams</b>, University of Glasgow<br><br>"Crowe offers an approach to the resurrection of Christ in Acts that provides a hermeneutic guide for untangling a number of knotty issues in the book. First, he shows how the resurrection is 'a major artery connecting various events and passages in Acts.' Second, he explores the implications of Luke's narrative presentation of this theme for biblical and systematic theology. This is a remarkably helpful resource for reflection on the theology of Acts and its connection with the rest of Scripture."<br>--<b>David Peterson</b>, Moore Theological College, Sydney, Australia (emeritus)<br><br>"<i>The Hope of Israel</i> breaks significant new ground with the comprehensive treatment it provides of the central place of Christ's resurrection in Acts. Especially valuable, marked by numerous important insights, is Crowe's substantial discussion of the theological significance of the resurrection. This book is an impressive achievement. I commend it most highly."<br>--<b>Richard&nbsp;B. Gaffin&nbsp;Jr.</b>, Westminster Theological Seminary (emeritus)<br><br>"With careful exegesis, informed by the salvation-historical framework of Acts, Crowe persuasively demonstrates the centrality and saving significance of the resurrection of Christ in the book of Acts.

There's a beautiful old inn for sale along the Little River that will do perfectly. Of course, Grace's family is scandalized. After all, she's a middle-aged widow! And as a career homemaker, she's always been available for babysitting, chauffeuring, and generally being the peacemaker among her grown children. Has Grace lost her mind?

As Grace overrides her family&#x2019;s disapproval and works to establish the new Mimosa Inn, she finds Jack, despite his painful past and sordid reputation, stirring in her a sensuality that as a widow she had long forgotten. Together, they experience the rediscovery of forgotten dreams, a reconnection with one&#x2019;s true self and God, and a reminder of the power found in love grounded in trust instead of easy charm.

But every clue yielded a new unanswered question. Quite involuntarily I found myself taking one step after the other.... Cumulus clouds mirrored in a shop window became calving glaciers, patches of old snow in city parks became great floes of ice. The Arctic Ocean lay at my window. Much the same thing must have happened to Mazzini." <p>Painstakingly retracing Mazzini's steps, the narrator simultaneously reconstructs the dramatic and fantastic story of the nineteenth-century journey, using actual letters and diaries of the members of that harrowing expedition. These documents--sometimes surprisingly poetic and moving--combine in the narrator's imagination to evoke as never before the awful beauty of the world's farthest northern reaches. </p><p>In a novel as crystalline as the polar ice, as penetrating as the arctic cold, Christopher Ransmayr spins an adventure tale both spellbinding and paradoxical in its subversive undermining of conventional notions of heroism and exploration. </p><p>"[Ransmayr's] handling of the archives and his narrative of the polar expedition, his vivid description of the Arctic itself, might easily have come from a good imaginative historian: a Barbara Tuchman, say, or a J.C. Beaglehole. As a result, this is to some extent a book of information about difficult travel in one of the bleakest places on earth.... Most important of all, the novelist strips away the spurious glamour that usually attaches itself to the idea of hard traveling."--New York Times Book Review </p><p>"Ransmayr has taken a sort of speculative freedom that a more traditional narrative might not allow. If we do not--cannot, perhaps--have the interior life of the commanders and crew, we receive by way of balance an elaborate and frequently lyrical meditation on the metaphysics of exploration."--Times Literary Supplement (London) </p><p>"Christoph Ransmayr has written a curious novel that conveys the distancing, the numbness, of Arctic.... Ransmayer's real protagonist is obsession itself, the call of the wild."--Los Angeles Times </p><p>"A rousing trek to the Arctic, [The Terrors of Ice and Darkness] is also a subversive speculation--philosophical, psychological, and linguistic--on nature's (and man's) icy heart of darkness."--The Boston Phoenix </p><p>"A nameless and largely invisible narrator recounts the 1981 disappearance of one Josef Mazzini, whose fascination with a 19th-century polar expedition has pulled him north, to the furthest arctic settlements. Accounts of the two journeys intersect and diverge, challenging the notion of history as linear, seducing the reader with startlingly detailed descriptions of polar exploration.... This aggressively intelligent narrative transforms the polar regions into unusually fertile ground."--Publishers Weekly </p><p>"Fascinating, consummately crafted...Ransmayr's language is every bit as artful as [Michael] Ondaatje's, and he has a firmer grasp of narrative suspense. Best of all, he has latched onto a story device that catches the reader right up in his Arctic obsessions.... The terror and the lure of the Arctic become one and the same thing in his hands. He conjures them up in their full, seductive glory."--San Francisco Chronicle </p><p>"A brilliant interweaving of journeys and voyages....

Sixteen-year-old Julio Montague's parents have moved their family to Cincinnati, OH, in order to get their son out of his gang-ridden high school in Corpus Christi, TX. Romiette Cappelle, also 16, is the daughter of successful African-American parents and the granddaughter of college professors. When these two young people, both from proud heritages, begin a romance, they must deal not only with their parents' prejudices but also with the threats of a local gang called The Family. At times, Romiette and Julio effectively parallels and contemporizes the original story. The young couple meet, not at the Capulets' feast, but in an Internet chat room. Julio's friend, Ben Olsen (read Benvolio), who looks like a punk rocker, has an optimistic and irreverent attitude that balances Julio's passion and volatility. At other times, the allusions to the play are obvious and heavy-handed. Nonetheless, this novel is more than simply a carefully plotted teenage romance. Draper gives a realistic portrayal of the interactions among high school students as well as their relationships with their parents. The book also examines how gangs can gain power and take control. All of the characters have unique voices and the writing style shifts according to the action. Romiette and Julio would be a wonderful curriculum tie-in book, but it also stands alone as a first-rate novel about contemporary teens.<br><i>Jane Halsall, McHenry Public Library District, IL </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nouns &amp; Verbs: New and Selected Poems</h2><p><p><strong>A major new collection from one of our best loved, most celebrated, and most original poets</strong> </p><p>Deeply personal but also expansive in its imaginative scope, <em>Nouns &amp; Verbs</em> brings together thirty-five years of writing from Campbell McGrath, one of America&#x2019;s most highly lauded poets.

Dick&#x2019;s earliest novels, written when he was just twenty-four years old. It tells the story of three Americans left behind in China by their employer, biding their time as the Communists advance. As they while away the days, both the young and na�ve Carl Fitter and the older and worldly Verne Tildon vie for the affections of Barbara Mahler, a woman who may not be so tough-as-nails as she acts. But Carl&#x2019;s innocence and Verne&#x2019;s boorishness could end up driving Barbara away from both.</p></p><p><p>Over a writing career that spanned three decades, PHILIP K. DICK (1928&#x2013;1982) published 36 science fiction novels and 121 short stories in which he explored the essence of what makes man human and the dangers of centralized power. Toward the end of his life, his work turned toward deeply personal, metaphysical questions concerning the nature of God. Eleven novels and short stories have been adapted to film,&nbsp;notably&nbsp;<i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall,</i><i>Minority Report,</i> and <i>A Scanner Darkly. </i>The recipient of critical acclaim and numerous awards throughout his career, Dick was inducted into the&nbsp;Science Fiction&nbsp;Hall of Fame in 2005, and in 2007 the Library of America published a selection of his novels in three volumes. His work has been translated into&nbsp;more than twenty-five&nbsp;languages.</p>&#34;The fascination of the novel lies in spotting the themes that Dick would later develop and make his own: the malleability of perceived reality, the imposition of the fake on the real and the struggle between good and evil.

Through her night vision goggles, the slightly fuzzy green imagery of heavily wooded banks was blurred even further by the shuddering of the helicopter as it roared along above the wave tops. A solid nor&#x2019;easter was blowing directly up the mouth of the river, adding an extra thirty knots to their airspeed but demanding extreme levels of concentration from Captain Tim Lindell and his copilot as they guided the chopper through hostile, if poorly guarded, airspace. Far behind them, no one paid their improvised helicopter carrier much mind&#x2014;a battered and rusty container vessel salvaged from Mexico. Royse didn&#x2019;t like to ponder what would have happened if the vessel had been detected by the South American Federation Navy. <br><br>Hell, probably not much to worry about, she consoled herself. It&#x2019;s just a paper navy at best. Most of their top ships laid up in docks anyhow, just rusting away. <br><br>A bit like the U.S. Navy nowadays, she thought. <br><br>Lindell had not spoken for five minutes, which still made him a hell of a lot chattier than their passenger: the spook. Michelle knew the woman had to be a spook because in spite of the faded summer-weight BDUs she wore, the kit they had loaded for her was all high-spec exotic stuff, the sort of gear the military simply couldn&#x2019;t afford nowadays. No way the army or SOCOM was running this operation. They were just providing a bus service for some ghost recon superwoman who&#x2019;d drifted down from far above the upper reaches of the tier-one food chain. <br><br>Michelle snuck a sideways glance at the passenger. The woman wasn&#x2019;t unfriendly, not like some of the ego monsters she&#x2019;d met while shuttling T1 operators around. But she was entirely self-contained; she spoke only when necessary and had a way of discouraging questions without actually asking you to mind your own business. She stood maybe an inch taller than Michelle, but even in her BDUs, body armor, webbing, and equipment, she seemed . . . well, not slighter&#x2014;perhaps more wiry. There was a tightly wound intensity about this spook that made being in her presence distinctly uncomfortable. Impossible to guess her age under all that kit, but Michelle thought maybe early to middle thirties. The woman&#x2019;s physique looked totally ripped, but her eyes were old beneath a stray lock of dirty blond hair. <br><br>Royse looked away quickly as their mystery passenger shifted position. She was happy enough to attend to her duties while Jane Bond sat in a furious still-life study of cold impacted rage. <br><br>For the moment, those duties mostly involved scanning the shore- line north of the river. Nothing appeared to move out there on what once had been the Uruguayan side of the border. Not now, though. Now it was all part of la Federaci�n. A few bright emerald pinpricks of light burned in a cluster about ten miles inland, but the shoreline was dark. The Black Hawk banked gently a few degrees to the northeast, taking them over land for the first time. Michelle craned her head to peer over her shoulder into the cabin, which glowed like a child&#x2019;s idea of a fairy cave in her night vision goggles. Far ahead of them, she could make out a faint dome of opalescent light on the horizon, marking the location of the Federation Navy&#x2019;s fleet base. <br><br>She would have sneered at the vanity of the pompous title &#x201c;fleet base&#x201d; if not for the fact that their own aircraft was held together with hundred-mile-an-hour tape, bailing wire, and promises and that most of the U.S. military bases she&#x2019;d flown out of in the close to five years since March 2003 had all suffered from the same air of neglect and making do. Salvaged gear left exposed to the elements or in compromised warehouses and storage depots took you only so far. <br><br>Yep, two paper tigers staring each other down in a burning barn&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the world of tomorrow. What a fucking joke. <br><br>&#x201c;Five minutes to insertion.&#x201d; <br><br>Captain Lindell&#x2019;s voice barely registered in her earphones over the roar of the engine and the deep thrumming bass note of the chopper blades. It was as though the tension had strangled his voice down to a clenched murmur. Royse held up her hand with all five fingers splayed and nodded at the spook. She was already preparing herself but nodded back, anyway. Michelle had watched the woman take inventory of her load before they lifted off from the container ship, three hundred miles off the coast. She watched her repeat the performance now that they were almost at their destination. <br><br>A minute later, obviously having reassured herself that she had not forgotten her passport, wallet, or Gerber Mark 2 fighting knife, the woman closed her eyes and let her head loll back until her helmet touched the bulkhead behind her. It was the first human gesture, the first intimation of weakness, or fear, or exhaustion that Michelle had seen her make, and as quickly as it came, it passed. Her head snapped back up. Her eyes blinked once. <br><br>&#x201c;Two minutes out.&#x201d; <br><br>The woman chambered a round in her HK417, a metallic Kerrchung that never failed to lay a cold finger at the base of Royse&#x2019;s spine. The 5.56-mm HK416s she had seen here and there, but the 417 with the heavier 7.62-mm round had been a rumor until tonight. The spook&#x2019;s brand-new Heckler &amp; Koch was another sign that she wasn&#x2019;t your standard issue self-loving spec-ops asshole whispering, &#x201c;For I am the baddest motherfucker in the valley.&#x201d; No piece-of-shit M16 or M4 for this chick. <br><br>Fuck it, she figured. Another day, another dollar. <br><br>Michelle readied herself at the door, training the electric M134 mini- gun over the treetops, which rippled beneath her feet at 140 knots. Her knees bent to compensate for the sudden twisting, diving flight path as Lindell began to track the nap of the earth, heading for a small clearing marked on their maps as Objective Underwood. <br><br>&#x201c;Thirty seconds.&#x201d; <br><br>The Black Hawk pivoted, seeming to turn on a dime, as if Lindell were trying to throw them both out the rear hatch by way of momentum. The woman braced herself against the bulkhead, holding tight to a grab bar over her right shoulder. Royse sank deeper into a squat until her knees were bent almost at right angles. Then the inertia bled away swiftly as they came to hover over a patch of field between two clusters of trees. Michelle checked the ground beneath them and reported that the aircraft was clear. She signaled to the woman to step forward and hook up. <br><br>The spook needed no help attaching herself to the fast-rope apparatus. Royse had one second to look into her eyes before she stepped out and dropped away into the night. The woman did not look scared, but there was something haunting her eyes. Something in the back of the deep, clenched lines that made her face appear unusually long and drawn in the low-light amplification of the NVGs. <br><br>One brief nod. <br><br>A thumbs-up gesture and she was gone, dropping down into the darkness.<br>Caitlin fast-roped down to the clearing floor, which squelched under the tread of her canvas-sided jungle boots. She scanned the tree line for any hint of enemy presence without expecting to find it. If they were going to be fired on, chances were she would have seen the tracers arc- ing in while she was dangling, all but defenseless, in midair. Releasing the rope, she signaled to Staff Sergeant Royse that she was clear and hurried off to find cover as the chopper increased power and clawed up into the humid night.<br>A flick of the wrist revealed the time: 0126 hours. <br><br>She had four hours of movement before she would have to lay up for the day. It wouldn&#x2019;t take her all the way to her objective, but she planned to be well within observation range by the time the sun rose. <br><br>The Echelon field agent moved quickly away from the drop zone, heading north by northeast, following the track programmed into her mil-grade Navman GPS unit. The brush wrapped itself around her, slowing her down as soon as she&#x2019;d passed under the first tree canopy. Night vision goggles resolved the environment into a flat, eerily phosphorescent landscape of sinuous roots and vines, of fat nodding leaves and thick snarls of creeper, of rot and genesis. The smell of decay and of new life growing over the top of older worn-out vegetation was strong, almost cloying. Clusters of such flora dotted the grassland steppe behind her during this, the height of the South American sum- mer. It combined the worst of all possible worlds: a main course of humidity with a side platter of wide-open kill zones, topped off with jungle-like collections of trees, brush, and other plant life. <br><br>Caitlin was familiar with the fecund crush of the jungle. She&#x2019;d spent a good year and a half tracking two targets through the old-growth forests of Sumatra and Aceh long before the Disappearance while pos- ing as a Peace Corps volunteer helping to build schools. She knew the jungle. They had come to terms. <br><br>But the problem now was more than one of terrain&#x2014;this was a tactical nightmare. She proceeded to the nearest point of cover and pushed farther inside the forest. <br><br>Two hundred yards in, she came to a small stream that was a couple of feet across and easily forded. Shallow water gurgled down a slight but noticeable slope, where Caitlin spied a small animal drinking up- stream from her, a squat, barrel-shaped grazer of some sort. It sniffed the air cautiously a moment after she&#x2019;d spotted it but returned to drinking when no obvious threat came charging out of the night. A couple of boulders, huge moss-covered menhirs, formed a natural fort. Caitlin decided to lay up there for a minute. <br><br>The stream led most of the distance to her objective, covered by varying degrees of thick vegetation: it was the best bet for a concealed approach in the dark. It was also probably the most obvious . . . She pushed that thought away. Nothing could be done about it. Traipsing through open grassland in full gear was a sure way to get a third eye drilled into her forehead. <br><br>Hundreds of bugs scuttled away as she laid her HK417 against the rock. A giant centipede reared up as if to strike. Caitlin swiftly killed the insect with one slash of a spring-loaded wrist blade and then flicked the two halves away with gloved fingers. The last thing she needed was to call in an extraction because of a bug sting. <br><br>She let her senses expand out into the surrounding landscape, listening for human speech or footfall, the clink and rattle of poorly secured equipment; she sniffed the air just as the animal had, tasting it for the scent of man, or the last meal he&#x2019;d eaten, or the soap he had washed with, or not, as might be. When she was certain no immediate danger existed, she relaxed fractionally. Or rather, she redirected her energy to her first lay-up procedure. <br><br>Again she inventoried her equipment. Nobody wanted to be the guy who turned up at the beach without his towel, or the state-sponsored killer who forgot her ninja throwing stars . . . Okay, she conceded, I don&#x2019;t have ninja throwing stars. But it would be totally bad-ass if I did. <br><br>Caitlin flipped up the monocular night sight on her PVS-14s to check the digital map Velcroed to her left arm. As was so often the case nowadays, Echelon resources didn&#x2019;t stretch to a live overwatch link. No one had that&#x2014;not even the Russian SVR had the resources for live overwatch anymore. She was on her own, which was not entirely a bad thing. Nobody was recording her every move for an embarrassing moment with the media farther down the road. Nobody was barking at her through a headset, telling her to do shit that made no sense. She had good data, though, and with that and her experience, there wasn&#x2019;t much else Caitlin needed. <br><br>The little stream beside which she&#x2019;d laid up ran through the center of the dimly illuminated screen. Her position was marked with a blue dot. She hoped to follow the stream upslope for at least three klicks before it began to veer away from her intended destination, one of Roberto&#x2019;s many detention facilities, this one tucked away in an old police station about ten kilometers inland. The best intelligence they had placed her target there. Wales had called it a memory hole: a dark place where the regime stuffed away its mistakes, embarrassments, and occasional secrets. Caitlin wondered if they understood the nature of the secret they had stashed down here in the back forty of the former Uruguayan Republic. <br><br>She picked up the 417, resettled her pack a little more comfortably, and took a mouthful of chilled Gatorade from the camelback bladder woven into it. The brush reappeared in eldritch green as she snapped the PVS-14 back down over her dominant eye. The potbellied beast (was it a tapir&#x2014;was that what they were called?) scuttled back into the undergrowth as she began to move. <br><br>You&#x2019;re a long way south, Caitlin thought about the tapir. Maybe it had gotten loose from a zoo or something. <br><br>Time to move on herself. Quickly setting the GPS unit to vibrate when she had covered two and a half kilometers, Caitlin carefully stepped down onto the sandy creek bank from the small grassy bend on which she&#x2019;d been resting. <br><br>She was her own point and cover, responsible for her flanks and rear guard. She was alone, her natural state of being. Consciously pushing away thoughts of her husband and baby back at the safe house in Scot- land, willfully forgetting the life they had tried to make for themselves on the farm in Wiltshire, Caitlin Monroe, Echelon&#x2019;s senior surviving field agent, let her true nature take over. A predator, she stalked through the primordial heat&#x2014;claws out, fangs ready, all her senses twitching and straining, searching for prey. <br><br>It didn&#x2019;t matter to her that this part of the country, thinly populated before the Disappearance, was even more sparsely peopled now. She had been trained to assume the worst, to prepare for ill chance and disaster as a certainty. There were no large townships within thirty kilo- meters, and the terrain between here and the objective was undoubtedly deserted. El colapso had emptied it, and Roberto Morales&#x2019;s regime kept it that way. But still, she would move forward as though snares blocked her path at every turn. <br><br>She advanced in a creeping crouch, her knees bent, her thigh muscles and core strength tested by the weight of her equipment and the unnatural movement. Her body had recovered well from pregnancy and childbirth, however, and from the rigors of hunting and fighting in the huge open mausoleum of New York last spring. Three months back home with Bret and Monique had helped with that&#x2014;three months in which she regained her strength and bound it tightly with new layers of resolution and a fierce will to lay her hands on the man she blamed for nearly destroying her family. <br><br>Bilal Hans Baumer. Al Banna. <br><br>Or whatever he was calling himself these days. In Manhattan he had been known as the Emir. Now he was the target. Her target. As he had been for a year before the old world had fallen. <br><br>The barrel of Caitlin&#x2019;s 417 swept back and forth in a tight arc ...</p><h2>Angela Hartnett&#39;s Cucina: Three Generations of Italian Family Cooking</h2><p>The inspiration for all of Angela Harnett&#x2019;s award-winning dishes comes from the classic Italian cooking&nbsp;she learned at her grandmother's side.

Yet the interest in metaphysics persists and is showing signs of resurgence among students concerned with raising the most basic questions about life and being as a whole.</p><p>This book is an attempt to reopen the fundamental question of being and to pursue that question in a way that is critical and systematic. Oliva Blanchette begins by establishing the necessity of raising the question of being as being after the natural sciences and phenomenology have run their course and pursuing it according to a method that is properly metaphysical as well as critical. He then proceeds to examine how we think of being according to a logic that is at once universal and concrete leading to a transcendental conception of being as analogous. After elaborating on the properties of being as one, active, true, and good, the author inquires into the structure of being and its constitutive principles as becoming and as finite. This brings him to a consideration of how being is communicated among a plurality and a diversity of beings according to a universal order of nature and history. Blanchette concludes by showing the necessity of raising the question of a totally transcendent Being at the end of metaphysics and of answering the question in the affirmative, even though the essence of what we are affirming escapes the grasp of our understanding.</p><p>The discourse is thus shown to have a beginning, a middle, and an end of interest to anyone concerned with the defense of metaphysics not only as having a standing in philosophy but also as arriving at such a standing only through a critical reflection on being as given in experience. It requires a special interest in raising the universal question of being, but it is accessible to anyone who has arrived at the point of exercising critical judgment about what there is in reality in the course of any investigation that is scientific or phenomenological.</p><br><p></p><br><p> ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><br><p>Oliva Blanchette is Professor of Philosophy at Boston College.

Slade and Alexander are both journalists; they have brought together their finely honed skills at exacting the human dimension from epic events to produce a wonderful, original perspective on the battle and its aftermath. They rely on letters, diaries, local newspaper articles, and a wealth of rarely seen photographs. The result is a riveting portrait of people whose "ordinary" lives have been disrupted and forever changed by an unexpected cataclysm. There are fascinating accounts of the battle, the horrors of coping with the dead and wounded, and the reaction as swarms of reporters and bureaucrats engulf the town as it awaits the dedication of the national cemetery. This work is a treasure for Civil War enthusiasts and a vital addition to any library's Civil War collection. <i>Jay Freeman</i></p><h2>The Southern Question (Via Folios)</h2><p>Cultural Writing. Social Criticism. Translated from the Italian with an introduction by Pasquale Verdicchio. "It is hard to think of a better point of entry into Gramsci's thought than his essay on the 'Southern Question.' Written on the eve of Gramsci's arrest and imprisonment, this essay anticipates many of the major issues treated in the <em>Prison Notebooks</em>. Indeed, Gramsci himself initially conceived of his project of study and research in prison as an elaboration of the views he had first sketched in the 'Southern Question' essay. Verdicchio's edition/translation of this valuable work does much more than give Anglophone readers access to the text. The introduction, the annotations, and the supplementary materials he provides enable the reader to place Gramsci's essay firmly within the context in which it was composed and at the same time to appreciate the poignancy of its insights for the present time."&#x2014;Joseph Buttigieg, editor and translator of Gramsci's <em>Prison Notebooks</em>.</p><p>Antonio Gramsci is one of the founders of the Italian Communist Party (1921), the founder of the party newspaper L&#x2019;Unit� and of L&#x2019;Ordine Nuovo (The New Order), the theoretical and political organ of the socialist left in Turin (1919).

Because of the escalation of World War II, the project was suspended after less than a year, but not before Adams had produced this group of breathtaking images, which illustrate both his early innovations and the shape of his later, legendary career as America&#39;s foremost landscape photographer.The invitation to photograph the nation&#39;s parklands was the perfect assignment for Adams, as it allowed him to express his deepest convictions as artist, conservationist, and citizen. These stunning photographs of the natural geysers and terraces in Yellowstone, the rocks and ravines in the Grand Canyon, the winding rivers and majestic mountains in Glacier and Grand Teton national parks, the mysterious Carlsbad Caverns, the architecture of ancient Indian villages, and many other evocative views of the American West demonstrate the genius of Adams&#39; technical and aesthetic inventiveness. In these glorious, seminal images we see the inspired reverence for the wilderness that has made Ansel Adams&#39; work an enduring influence on the intertwining spirits of art and environmentalism, both so necessary for the preservation of our natural world.</p><p>It was the United States Department of Interior that commissioned Ansel Adams to document the country&#39;s national parks. Though the project was suspended after just one year because of World War II, Adams was still able to create quite a few astonishingly beautiful photographs of the American landscape. Arresting images of Yellowstone&#39;s geysers, the Grand Canyon&#39;s ravines, Glacier and Grand Teton national parks&#39; mountains and the southwest&#39;s ancient adobes fill the book&#39;s pages. Perusing this palm-sized volume is akin to touring the country&#39;s natural monuments with this most gifted nature photographer along as a companion.<b>Ansel Adams</b> (1902&#x2013;1984) is the author of more than a dozen books and one of the most prolific and highly acclaimed photographers of the twentieth century. He helped establish the department of photography at New Yorks Museum of Modern Art and founded The Friends of Photography in Carmel, California, and the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in Tucson. A member of the board of directors of the Sierra Club for thirty-seven years, Adams was instrumental in the growth of the American conservationist movement.<br> <br> <b>Alice Gray</b> is a writer and editor based in Louisville, Kentucky.

Mosse Series in the History of European Culture, Sexuality, and Ideas)</h2><p>Martin Jay tackles a question as old as Plato and still pressing today: what is reason, and what roles does and should it have in human endeavor?

They despaired, in particular, over the decay in the modern world of reason into mere instrumental rationality.

T. Joshi is one of the leading authorities on weird fiction, and in this expansive new study he provides a comprehensive history and analysis of the entire range of weird fiction from antiquity to the present day. This first volume focuses on weird fiction from the Epic of Gilgamesh (c. 1700 B.C.E.) to the end of the nineteenth century. Joshi focuses on key works of Greek and Latin literature that introduced many long-enduring motifs in weird literature. Moving on down through Dante, Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Milton, Joshi provides a compact overview of the several different strands of Gothic fiction, beginning with Horace Walpole&#39;s The Castle of Otranto (1764) and culminating with Charles Robert Maturin&#39;s Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), with detailed discussions of Ann Radcliffe, M. G. Lewis, Mary Shelley, and others. Edgar Allan Poe was a watershed in the history of weird fiction, and his fusion of psychological and supernatural horror was pioneering. He was followed by the prolific Irish writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu, numerous practitioners of the English ghost story (including Henry James and Edith Wharton), and the cynical Ambrose Bierce. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, Bram Stoker, Robert Louis Stevenson, Oscar Wilde, and others made weird fiction a genre that fused popular appeal with aesthetic richness.</p><p></p><h2>A Door in the Woods (Jimmy Fincher Saga)</h2><p>What begins as a summer-day climb up his favorite tree quickly takes an ugly turn for poor Jimmy Fincher, as he witnesses something that turns his perception of reality upside-down.

Liberal evangelicals&#x2014;despite how apolitical they claim to be&#x2014;are gaining ground, promoting a repackaged version of Christianity that distorts the authority of Scripture and is causing a mass exodus of young people from the teachings of Jesus Christ.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Distortion</i> Chelsen Vicari confronts this move away from authentic Christianity and the principles that have made America great. Arming you with Scripture, historic Christian teaching, and social science that specifically addresses the challenges confronting our country, she covers topics such as:<br> &nbsp;<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding the link between faith and policy<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unmasking the social justice disguise<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confronting the truth about homosexuality<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unveiling the Jesus feminists<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living out the truth with boldness and grace<br> &nbsp;<br> It is time to take a stand once again in the culture wars, this time for the sake of our youth and our future. To keep praying, keep acting, keep discerning truth, keep upholding Scripture as authority, and keep fighting on the battleground where Christianity and public policy collide. This is a great challenge. But it is one that every generation of evangelicals must be willing to take on for Jesus Christ.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is worth the battle. America needs us. The church needs you. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Chelsen Vicari</b> serves as the Institute on Religion and Democracy&#x2019;s evangelical program director.

The Bible is a great book. We really mean that. It&#x2019;s filled with heroes, villains, seductresses, world empires, grandeur, grossness, plot twists and an ending that will blow you away. 2. Kids would love to learn what&#x2019;s in the Bible. They would love it so much, that they&#x2019;d actually put effort into mastering it, if anybody would respect them enough to teach them. 3. The proven Classical Method is the best way to teach kids the amazing content of the Bible. A little about the Classical Method: The Classical Method divides a child&#x2019;s learning adventure into three stages: grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric, referred to collectively as the Trivium. During the grammar (or data) stage, a child&#x2019;s mind is like a thirsty sponge, absorbing information wherever it can. Kids in this stage memorize easily and are insatiably curious. In the dialectic state, a child begins to synthesize the data he&#x2019;s accumulated, connecting the dots and trying to understand how all of his stored information fits together. In the rhetoric stage, a young person begins to use his data-laden framework of the world to try to persuade and influence. The Classical Method of education has been the gold standard for millennia, producing the great minds of the Western intellectual tradition. As modern educators have recoiled from the rigors of the Classical Method, modern students have suffered. Clearly, this style of education is built on a foundation of data. Names, dates, locations, lists, descriptions. The more data a mind stores, the more dots it can connect, the more persuasive it can become. The broader the base, the taller the building. This drill book is designed for use in the grammar stage&#x2014;typically with kids 4-11 or 12 years old. It contains data, and lots of it. There are maps, timelines, genealogies, memory passages, lists of kings and covenants and more. But please remember: we present all this information not to puff up, or to show off. The vast amount of data is introduced so that when our kids reach the rhetoric stage, their sweet minds will have information to massage and assemble. If a kid reaches the rhetoric stage, where his mind is longing to put pieces together to make sense of the world, and he finds that he&#x2019;s missing lots of pieces, he gets frustrated. And surly. And rude. We don&#x2019;t want that, now do we? Owning a broad base of data equips a child for the daunting task of making sense of the world, and eventually making his mark in it. Such knowledge also prevents a young person from falling prey to harmful fads and destructive ideologies. It&#x2019;s not so easy to dupe a kid who is armed with facts. How to use this drill book This book reinforces the material introduced in Classical Sunday School each week. There are twelve weeks in a cycle, and twelve cycles in all. Daily review will allow your child (and you!) to master all this information. Practicing the memory work is actually quite enjoyable. Kids relish the rhymes and mnemonics, and shine when they begin to write words in Hebrew or draw detailed maps. And you&#x2019;ll appreciate a family project that brings you all together. At Sunday school, your child&#x2019;s teacher will present all of the &#x201c;data&#x201d; for the week. Parents are encouraged to be a part of the class whenever they are able. Your job at home is to drill the data so that your child will &#x201c;own it&#x201d; by the end of the week. All children in grade K-6 in a church will be on the same lesson, drilling the same material, so practice at home is truly a family affair. We suggest that you set aside ten minutes each day, ideally at the same time each day, to review this work&#x2014;often, breakfast or bedtime is a pleasant time to drill. The songs and other resources found on the website might prove helpful in mastering the material.

Leaving behind his fiancee, Lady Henrietta Lindsey, he must journey across tempestuous seas to India, an alien, exotic and beguiling land that will test his mettle to the very limit. For the princely state of Chintal is threatened both by intrigue from within and military might from without, and Hervey - sabre in hand - finds he is once more destined for the field of battle...&#34;Captain Hervey of the 6th Light Dragoons and ADC to the Duke of Wellington is back in the saddle ...He is as fascinating on horseback as Jack Aubrey is on the quarterdeck.&#34; - &#34;The Times&#34;.</p><p>Allan Mallinson was a soldier for thirty-five years, serving first with the infantry and then the cavalry. He began writing while still serving. His first book was a history of four regiments of British light dragoons, one of whose descendant regiments he commanded. It was followed by A Close Run Thing, the first novel in the acclaimed and bestselling series chronicling the life of a fictitious cavalry officer, Matthew Hervey, before and after Waterloo. His The Making of the British Army was shortlisted for several prizes, while his centenary history, 1914: Fight the Good Fight - Britain, the Army and the Coming of the First World War won the British Army&#39;s Book of the Year Award. Its sequel, Too Important for the Generals, is a provocative look at leadership during the Great War. Allan Mallinson also writes for The Times, is history editor for Unherd.com and reviews for the TLS and the Spectator. He lives on Salisbury Plain.&#34;A marvellous read, paced like a well-balanced symphony ...

Farmer might be called the forgotten man of the movement, overshadowed by Martin Luther King Jr., who was deeply influenced by Farmer&#x2019;s interpretation of Gandhi&#x2019;s concept of nonviolent protest.<br><br> Born in Marshall, Texas, in 1920, the son of a preacher, Farmer grew up with segregated movie theaters and &#x201c;White Only&#x201d; drinking fountains. This background impelled him to found the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942. That same year he mobilized the first sit-in in an all-white restaurant near the University of Chicago. Under Farmer&#x2019;s direction, CORE set the pattern for the civil rights movement by peaceful protests which eventually led to the dramatic &#x201c;Freedom Rides&#x201d; of the 1960s.<br><br> In <i>Lay Bare the Heart</i> Farmer tells the story of the heroic civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 1960s. This moving and unsparing personal account captures both the inspiring strengths and human weaknesses of a movement beset by rivalries, conflicts and betrayals. Farmer recalls meetings with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Jack and Bobby Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson (for whom he had great respect), and Lyndon Johnson (who, according to Farmer, used Adam Clayton Powell Jr., to thwart a major phase of the movement).<br><br> James Farmer has courageously worked for dignity for all people in the United States. In this book, he tells his story with forthright honesty.<br><br> First published in 1985 by Arbor House, this edition contains a new foreword by Don Carleton, director of the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin, and a new preface.</p><p>James Farmer taught history at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He received the Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1998. Dr. Farmer died in 1999.Chapter 28: President Johnson's giant frame leaned sideways over the arm of the leather upholstered chair in which he was sitting. <p>"Mr. Farmer, I've got to get this civil rights bill through Congress, and I'm going to do it. If I never do anything else in my whole life, I'm going to get this job done. . . . You civil rights leaders can help me on that. You all should tell the Republicans that if they vote for this bill, you'll tell your people to vote for them. . . . If I can't get the Republicans, then I'm going to have to get the Dixiecrats. That's the southern Democrats, you know. That's really going to be hard. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but somehow I'm going to have to break down their resistance." </p><p>We were interrupted by several incoming phone calls-senators returning the president's calls. He twisted arms, threatened and cajoled, and then looked up to make sure I was duly impressed with his efforts on behalf of the bill. </p><p>Between the calls, I asked, "Mr. President, how did you get to be this way? You're a southerner, and your congressional record on civil rights was not very good. What changed you?" </p><p>"I'll answer that question by quoting a friend of yours," he replied. "'Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, I'm free at last.'" </p><p>What he meant by that reference to King's march on Washington speech, of course, was that, as president, he was freed from accountability to a southern constituency and could be responsive to the needs of all the people. </p><p>"The southerners tell me," he went on, "that they'll buy this bill if I take the public accommodations section out. But I won't do that. The public accommodations part is the heart and the guts of this measure, and I will not remove it." </p><p>I asked him how he came to view public accommodations to be so important and he related a story in response. </p><p>"One day down in Texas many years ago, my maid was going on vacation with her husband. Lady Bird-that's Mrs. Johnson, you know-told the maid to take our dog with her; we had a little beagle. My maid said, 'Mrs. Johnson, please don't make me take that dog with me. My husband and I will be driving across the South and it's going to be tough enough finding places to stay, just being black, without having a dog with us.' </p><p>"Mr. Farmer, that made me cry. Just to think that a wonderful woman like my maid couldn't stay in any hotel she wanted to. It made me mad. I'd lived in Texas all my life and I'd never thought about it before. Right then I swore that if I ever got any power, I would do something about it. Now I have some power and by God I'm going to do something about it." </p><p>I looked at him and said nothing. I found myself thinking of that terrible day less than a month earlier when President Kennedy's brains were blown out in Texas, and of the call I received from Johnson three days later. </p><p>"Mr. Farmer, this is Lyndon Johnson. I first wanted to call and tell you that I remember when you came to my office when I was vice- president. You made a good suggestion to me that helped me a lot. And I asked you to do something for me, and you followed through on that. I just want you to know that I appreciated that a lot." </p><p>"Thank you, Mr. President." </p><p>"Now, we're going to have to pick up this ball and run with it. I'm going to need your help in the months and maybe the years that lie ahead, and I hope I'll get it." </p><p>"If we're going the same way, Mr. President, we can go together." </p><p>"I'm glad to hear you say that. Next time you're in Washington, drop by and see me." </p><p>I knew that Johnson had to win the confidence of black leaders, for the absence of their trust had helped deny him the nomination in 1960. Nevertheless, I was flattered by what came to be known as "the Johnson treatment." Never before had I been called by a president. </p><p>Now, here I was in the Oval Office, still being buttered up by that flattery. The fact that I knew what was happening did not lessen its effectiveness. </p><p>He slapped his knee and drawled, "Well, Jim, I know you're interested in a lot of other things besides this bill. What else can I do to help your cause?" </p><p>I leaned back in the big chair and unbuttoned my collar and loosened tie; I had gained weight and the shirt was not comfortable. </p><p>"Mr. President, there is one thing that keeps me awake nights. We've battered many doors open, and when the civil rights bill is enacted into law, many walls will come tumbling down. Yet, there are millions of Americans of all races who won't be able to walk through those doors or across those fallen walls. The reason? A lack of basic educational skills; the inability to read, write, and compute." </p><p>"I agree a thousand percent," the president said, "but what are we going to do about it? </p><p>"We have in the movement thousands of volunteers with intelligence, dedication, and boundless energies, who don't consider sitting-in, freedom riding, and going to jail to be the most meaningful things in the world any longer. They're standing by now, waiting for direction. Reading specialists can instruct them in teaching adults to read, and we can fan them out through the country. There are over twenty million adults who cannot read up to a fourth-grade level. I believe we can wipe out that functional illiteracy in ten to fifteen years." </p><p>"I think that's a great idea," said Johnson, "and we can make it work."</p></p><h2>The Decline of the West; Volume I</h2><p><p>This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

LONGLISTED FOR THE CENTER FOR FICTION'S FIRST NOVEL PRIZE. </b></p><p><b>Named one of the Best Books of 2018 by NPR, <i>Bookforum</i> and <i>Bustle</i>. One of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>'s 10 Best Debut Novels of 2018. An Amazon Best Book of the Month and named a fall read by <i>Buzzfeed, Nylon, Entertainment Weekly, Elle, Vanity Fair, Vulture,</i> <i>Refinery29</i> and <i>Mind Body Green</i></b><br><b></b><br><b>A gorgeous, raw debut novel about a young woman braving the ups and downs of motherhood in a fractured America</b></p><p>In Lydia Kiesling&#x2019;s razor-sharp debut novel, <i>The Golden State</i>, we accompany Daphne, a young mother on the edge of a breakdown, as she flees her sensible but strained life in San Francisco for the high desert of Altavista with her toddler, Honey. Bucking under the weight of being a single parent&#x2015;her Turkish husband is unable to return to the United States because of a &#x201c;processing error&#x201d;&#x2015;Daphne takes refuge in a mobile home left to her by her grandparents in hopes that the quiet will bring clarity. </p><p>But clarity proves elusive. Over the next ten days Daphne is anxious, she behaves a little erratically, she drinks too much. She wanders the town looking for anyone and anything to punctuate the long hours alone with the baby. Among others, she meets Cindy, a neighbor who is active in a secessionist movement, and befriends the elderly Alice, who has traveled to Altavista as she approaches the end of her life. When her relationships with these women culminate in a dangerous standoff, Daphne must reconcile her inner narrative with the reality of a deeply divided world. </p><p>Keenly observed, bristling with humor, and set against the beauty of a little-known part of California, <i>The Golden State</i> is about class and cultural breakdowns, and desperate attempts to bridge old and new worlds. But more than anything, it is about motherhood: its voracious worry, frequent tedium, and enthralling, wondrous love.</p></p><p><b>Lydia Kiesling</b> is the editor of <i>The Millions</i>. Her debut novel, <i>The Golden State</i>, was longlisted for the Center for Fiction's First Novel Prize. Her essays and criticism have appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Slate</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i> online, and have been recognized in <i>The Best American Essays 2016</i>. Kiesling lives in San Francisco with her family.<p>"<i>The Golden State</i> anchors Daphne&#x2019;s journey in the visceral and material realities of motherhood . . . The novel beautifully depicts the golden light of California, the smell of the fescue grasses, the thinness of the air, and the way that Daphne and Honey often feel overwhelmed by the scale of the spaces they find themselves in. The result is less an untroubled analogy between the landscapes of motherhood and the American West than an invitation to think more deeply about how limited our canonical literary imaginings of each have been." --<b>Sarah Blackwood, <i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p>"Kiesling vividly renders the high desert town, its beauty and its starkness, its juniper-scented air and its neglect, the way it both centers and saps Daphne. Kiesling is also an astute cultural commentator, shedding light on our current political divide and university politics and Orientalism and the barbarism of America past and present while shedding light on parts of California often ignored by news and literature. She reminds us that the Golden State is more complexly storied than we often give it credit for; she also reminds us that for all its stretches of tedium and potential for heartbreak, the state of raising a young child can be pretty golden, too." --<b>Gayle Brandeis</b>, <b><i>San Francisco Chronicle </i></b></p><p>"Dry, observant, self-aware, smart without being showy . . . Respectfully but unsentimentally, [Lydia Kiesling] articulates the sorts of emotional drama that undergirds life with a small child, giving shape and consequence to the joy, boredom, nostalgia, tenderness, and frustration that parenting constantly provokes . . . An excellent, accomplished, original novel, one of the best I&#x2019;ve read in a while." --<b>Adelle Waldman, <i>Bookforum</i></b></p><p>"Gorgeously written, deeply engaging, character-driven . . . It's been a very long time since my daughters were toddlers, but Daphne's trenchant observations of her complicated feelings brought it all back." --<b>Nancy Pearl, <i>NPR</i> (Best Books of 2018)</b></p><p>"Remarkable . . . What Kiesling syntactically accomplishes is an exquisite look at the gulf between the narrow repetitive toil of motherhood and the sprawling intelligence of the mother that makes baby care so maddening . . . We don&#x2019;t get to enter a golden state without conflict or boredom. But love can persist despite crappy Skype connections, and wonder can flourish in the interstices between tasks." --<b>Heather Abel, <i>Slate</i></b></p><p>"In heartrending prose, Lydia Kiesling weaves through an exploration of the political and the private, fear and love, survival and obligation, loneliness and longing." --<b>Arianna Rebolini, </b><i><b>Buzzfeed</b> </i><b>(Best Books of Fall 2018)</b></p><p>"a quiet adventure that tackles questions of motherhood, academic pursuits, sexism, and immigration. In a narrative that could have become claustrophobic, Kiesling&#x2019;s prose feels open and propulsive as Daphne ponders issues that plague all mothers, women, people." --<b><i>Vanity Fair</i> (This Fall's Best Fiction)</b></p><p>"A first novel of deep personal specificity that also illuminates broad cultural rifts." --<b>Boris Kachka, <i>Vulture </i>(8 New Books You Should Read This September)</b></p><p><b>"</b>Motherhood and home are two of the themes with which Lydia Kiesling grapples in <i>The Golden State,</i> a lucid, lyrical look at the often alienating, disorienting experience of early motherhood, the way in which it frays at already unraveling nerves, and the way in which external realities contribute to that fraying, that fuzziness, when the fragility of the world around and within us becomes all too apparent."--<b>Kristen Iversen, <i>NYLON</i></b></p><p>"Already poised to be one of the great (and greatly inventive) novels about motherhood." --<b>Elena Nicolaou, <i>Refinery29 (</i>The Books of September) </b></p><p>"The overwhelming love and loathsome, crushing boredom of mothering a young child arrive in profound, convincing and equal measure . . . <i>The Golden State </i>not only puts fathomless familial love on display, but also unleashes the power of fiction to provoke empathy, shame, fear, imagination, memories, despair and joy." <b>--Lou Fancher, <i>The San Jose Mercury News</i></b></p><p>"Kiesling&#x2019;s intimate, culturally perceptive debut portrays a frazzled mother and a fractious America, both verging on meltdown . . . Kiesling depicts parenting in the digital age with humor and brutal honesty and offers insights into language, academics, and even the United Nations. But perhaps best of all is her thought-provoking portrait of a pioneer community in decline as anger and obsession fray bonds between neighbors, family, and fellow citizens." <b>--<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)</b></p><p>"First novelist Kiesling nails the particular travails of new mothers, puts a human face on immigration issues, and adds some contemporary political commentary . . . There's so much to love about this novel . . . Strongly recommended for readers who enjoy contemporary literary fiction and can handle a few swear words." --<b><i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)</b></p><p>"Lydia Kiesling&#x2019;s first novel encapsulates the intense and often conflicting feelings of early parenthood: frustration, tenderness, isolation. By playing with punctuation and sentence structure, Kiesling immerses the reader in the fragile headspace of the anxious new mother. With a style reminiscent of Claire Vaye Watkins and Sarah Stonich, <i>The Golden State</i> sparks the lovely, lonely feelings inside us all&#x201d; --<i><b>Booklist</b></i></p><p>"Kiesling is a talented author . . . with a unique voice. She&#x2019;s very smart, very funny, and wonderfully empathetic . . . [A] skilled and promising writer" --<i><b>Kirkus</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Golden State</i> is a perfect evocation of the beautiful, strange, frightening, funny territory of new motherhood. Lydia Kiesling writes with great intelligence and candor about the surreal topography of a day with an infant, and toggles skillfully between the landscape of Daphne&#x2019;s interior and the California desert, her postpartum body and the body politic. A love story for our fractured era.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Karen Russell, author of <i>Vampires in the Lemon Grove</i> and <i>Swamplandia!</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Golden Stat</i>e is a rare and important novel not only because it depicts with blazing accuracy the everyday experience of raising a young child but also because it uses the quotidian to reveal larger truths about humanity&#x2019;s gifts and deficits. In Lydia Kiesling&#x2019;s remarkable first novel, the familiar and the foreign are not so different after all, and what we remember may not be what is. A profound book.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Edan Lepucki, author of <i>Woman No. 17</i> and <i>California</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Golden State</i> is spectacularly good at rendering maternal obsession and panic.

Beautifully, intricately written, true to life and to women&#x2019;s experience in particular; full of insight and humor and memorable landscapes, <i>The Golden State</i> is a marvelous and captivating literary debut.&#x201d; <b>&#x2015;Michelle Huneven, author of <i>Off Course</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;A big, rollicking adventure of a novel, overflowing with the kind of intense, fractal consciousness life with small children entails, the world at once collapsed and expanded infinitely, in which whole lifetimes are contained in each and every single day, Lydia Kiesling&#x2019;s <i>The Golden State</i> is as funny and alive a story as they come.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Elisa Albert, author of <i>After Birth</i></b></p></p><h2>Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone?</h2><p>At once an intimate autobiography and a collective memory of the Palestinian people, Darwish&#x2019;s intertwined poems are collective cries, songs, and glimpses of the human condition. Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone? is a poetry of myth and history, of exile and suspended time, of an identity bound to his displaced people and to the rich Arabic language. Darwish&#x2019;s poems &#x2013; specific and symbolic, simple and profound &#x2013; are historical glimpses, existential queries, chants of pain and injustice of a people separated from their land.</p><p>Mahmoud Darwish (1941&#x2013;2008) was born in the village of al-Birwa, in the Galilee, Palestine. He became a refugee at age seven. He worked as a journalist and editor in Haifa and left to study in Moscow in 1970. His exilic journey took him to Cairo, Beirut, Tunis, Paris, Amman, and Ramallah, where he settled in 1995. He is one of the most celebrated and revered poets in the Arab world. He published more than thirty books, and his poetry has been translated into thirty-five languages. Darwish was named a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters by France in 1993, was awarded the Lannan Cultural Freedom Prize in 2001, the Prince Claus Awardin 2004, and the Cairo Prize for Arabic Poetry in 2007.

Witnesses describe being kidnapped by large-headed, black-eyed creatures from other worlds. Those same creatures have become popularly known as "the Grays." There is, however, another aspect to the alien abduction controversy. </p><p>Abductees very often report being followed and spied upon by military and government personnel. It is typical for abductees to see black helicopters hovering directly over their homes in an intimidating manner. Phone calls are monitored. Emails are hacked into. Strange men dressed in black suits are seen photographing the homes of the abductees. All of this brings us to the matter of what have become known in the domain of alien abduction research as "Military Abductions," or "MILABS."</p><p>According to numerous abductees, after being kidnapped by aliens they are kidnapped again . . . by the government. These follow-up events are the work of a powerful group hidden deep within the military and the intelligence community. It is the secret agenda of this highly classified organization to figure out what the so-called Grays are really up to. And, the best way for the government to get the answers is to interrogate those who have come face-to-face with the UFO phenomenon: the abductees. Why is the government secretly compiling files on alien abductees? Is the alien abduction issue so sinister that it has become a matter of national security proportions?</p></p><p><b>Nick Redfern</b> is the author of numerous books on conspiracies and paranormal and unexplained mysteries.

Unfortunately, the once beautiful Lake Tai, renowned for its clear waters, is now covered by fetid algae, its waters polluted by toxic runoff from local manufacturing plants. Then the director of one of the manufacturing plants responsible for the pollution is murdered and the leader of the local ecological group is the primary suspect of the local police. Now Inspector Chen must tread carefully if he is to uncover the truth behind the brutal murder and find a measure of justice for both the victim and the accused.</p></p><p><p>QIU XIAOLONG is a poet and author of several previous novels featuring Inspector Chen as well as <i>Years of Red Dust</i>, a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Books of 2010. Born and raised in Shanghai, Qiu lives with his family in St. Louis, Missouri.</p><b>ONE</b><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>CHIEF INSPECTOR CHEN CAO of the Shanghai Police Bureau found himself standing in front of the gate to the Wuxi Cadre Recreation Center.<br>His vacation in the city of Wuxi was totally unexpected. Earlier that Sunday morning, Chen was in Zhenjiang, attending an intensive political seminar for emerging Party officials training for &#x201c;new responsibilities,&#x201d; when he got a phone call from Comrade Secretary Zhao, the former second secretary of the Central Party Discipline Committee. Though retired, Zhao remained one of the most influential figures in Beijing. Zhao was too busy to take a vacation arranged for him at the center in Wuxi, so he offered it to Chen instead.<br>Chen was in no position to decline such a well-meant offer, coming from the Forbidden City. So he immediately left the seminar at the Zhenjiang Party School, took a long-distance bus to Wuxi station, and then a taxi to the center.<br>He had heard a lot about the center, which was located in a scenic area of the city. It was something like a combination of a resort and a sanatorium, known for its special service to high-ranking cadres. There were strict regulations about the Party cadre rank required for admission, and Chen was nowhere close to that rank. Chen knew an exception was being made because of Zhao. Qiao Liangxing, the director of the center, was not around when Chen arrived. A front desk receptionist greeted Chen and led him to a white European-style villa, with tall marble columns in front, enclosed by an iron fence with gilded spikes and a shining stainless-steel gate. The villa stood alone on a tree-shaded hill, separate from other buildings. The receptionist showed Chen all due respect, as if the villa being allocated to him determined his status rather than the other way round. Without any other specific instructions from Qiao, however, all she could do was check Chen in with a detailed introduction to the center and its location: Yuantouzhu, or Turtle Head Park.<br>&#x201c;Our center gets its name from a huge rock projecting over the Tai Lake, like a turtle tossing its head above the water. The park was founded in 1918 and covers an area of five hundred hectares. It is a scenic peninsula on the northwest shore of the lake, surrounded by green hills and clear water; it is considered the best resort area in Wuxi. As for the center, at the south end of the peninsula, it was built in the early fifties for high-ranking cadres.&#x201d;<br>While listening to her introduction, Chen reflected on the way China took for granted the assumption that the Communist Party cadres, having conquered the country, deserved to enjoy all sorts of luxurious treatment.<br>&#x201c;Last but not the least, people staying here can easily walk into the park, but the tourists in the park may only look at the center through the gate. So enjoy your vacation here,&#x201d; the receptionist concluded, smiling, leaving the key as well as a park pass on a mahogany table in the hall before she left, closing the door carefully after her.<br>Chen moved to the front window. Looking out, he saw part of a curving driveway lined with shrubs and evergreen, and then further down the wooded hill, another driveway for someone else&#x2019;s villa. To the other side, there were rows of multistory buildings, with identically shaped balconies aligned like matchboxes, as those in a large new hotel. He didn&#x2019;t have a panoramic view of the center, but his villa was undoubtedly one reserved for top Party cadres.<br>It was a nice, large building consisting of nine rooms in all. He had no idea what to do with all those rooms as he walked upstairs and downstairs, examining one after another. He finally put his small suitcase in the master bedroom on the first floor, which commanded a fantastic lake view. Adjacent to the bedroom was a spacious living room, featuring a marble fireplace with a copper screen in an exquisite pattern, a black leather sectional sofa, and an LCD TV. One side of the room was a wall of tall windows overlooking Tai Lake.<br>Also on the first floor was a study with custom-made book shelves, some books, and a desk with a brand new laptop on it. The windows in the study were large, but looked out on the driveway and the hill beyond it.<br>Chen went back to the living room and started to pace about, stepping on and off an apricot Persian rug. His footsteps echoed through the entire building. Finally he decided to take a bath. He grabbed a cup and a bottle of Perrier from a silver tray on a corner table and settled himself in the master bathroom, which also had a scenic view.<br>Soaking in the tub, he had the luxurious feeling of becoming one with the lake, as he watched the tiny bubbles rising in his glass of Perrier.<br>Outside, a rock frog was croaking intermittently, and there was the murmur of an unseen cascade. Looking out, Chen discovered that the lambent melody was actually coming from a tiny speaker hidden in a rock under the window.<br>Of late, Chen often felt worn out. With one &#x201c;special case&#x201d; after another on his hands, he hadn&#x2019;t been able to take a break for months. A vacation could at least take his mind temporarily off his responsibilities and obligations.<br>Besides, there was nothing really important being handled by his Special Case Squad at the moment, and if something should come up, Wuxi was only an hour&#x2019;s trip from Shanghai by train. If need be, he could easily hurry back. In the meantime, though, his longtime partner, Detective Yu Guangming, should be able to take care of things there.<br>But it didn&#x2019;t take long before the chief inspector felt a slight suggestion&#x2014;as if it was rising up from the still water in the tub&#x2014;of loneliness, which was only magnified by the enormous size of the empty building.<br>The bubbles in the French water were gone, so he got out of the tub, put on his clothes, stuffed the paperback he brought with him into his pants pocket, and went out for a walk.<br>The center was connected, as the receptionist had said, to the park by a back entrance. Through the fence he saw tourists pointing and posing with cameras. He was not keen on becoming a tourist just yet, so he headed in the other direction, along a quiet, small road.<br>He had probably come in along the same route earlier, but sitting in the back of a taxi, he hadn&#x2019;t been able to see much. There wasn&#x2019;t anyone in the area, with the exception of an occasional car driving by at high speed. The road was fairly narrow. On one side, there was a wire fence stretching along like a wall, and a bushy, unkempt slope beyond it that stretched over to a wider road in the distance. On the other side, hills were rolling and rising upward here and there, interspersed with tourist attraction signs.<br>Ahead the road merged into a tiny square with bus stop shelters, a tea stall with bowls spread out on a makeshift table with a couple of benches, and a pavilionlike kiosk with a roof that was held up by vermillion posts, which sold all sorts of souvenirs. A group of people were getting off a gray bus, most of them carrying maps in their hands. The square couldn&#x2019;t be far from the park.<br>He felt anonymous, yet contentedly so. He strolled about, taking out his own tourist map of Wuxi, which he had bought earlier at the bus station.<br>He hadn&#x2019;t visited Wuxi for years. As a child, he and his parents had taken a day trip, riding from one tourist stop to another. Cutting across the square, he noted that it appeared quite different from what he remembered.<br>He was soon lost, in spite of the map. Like Shanghai, Wuxi had been changing dramatically in recent years. There were quite a few new street names that were unavailable or unrecognizable from his outdated map.<br>But he wasn&#x2019;t worried. If he couldn&#x2019;t find his way back, he could always hail a taxi. He liked walking&#x2014;even more so as he slipped into the role of a tourist, a sort of different identity. Perhaps he was still not over having been pushed into becoming a cop when he graduated college years ago.<br>After passing a street corner convenience store with a twenty-four-hour-business sign, he ventured into a side street, and then into another one&#x2014;a shabbier, somber, cobble-covered, and yet quaint one&#x2014;which was almost deserted. This street seemed to fit into his memory of the city. Toward the end of it, he slowed down at the sight of a dilapidated eatery. It had a red wooden door and white walls, with a couple of rough tables and benches outside and several more inside, and an orange paper pinwheel spinning in the rustic window. Outside, there was a colorful row of wooden and plastic basins with fish swimming in some and rice paddy eels in others. Eels were usually placed in a basin without water, Chen reflected.<br>Perhaps because it was past lunchtime, or perhaps because of the location, Chen was the only one lingering there, except for a white cat with a black patch on its forehead, dozing by the worn-out threshold.<br>Chen decided to sit at a table outside, with a bamboo container holding a bunch of disposable chopsticks like flowers. It was a warm day for May, and he had walked quite a distance. Wiping the sweat from his forehead, he was grateful for a fresh breeze coming fitfully along the street.<br>An old man came shuffling out of the kitchen in the rear, carrying a dog-eared menu. Most likely he was the owner, chef, and waiter here.<br>&#x201c;Anything particular you would like, sir?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just a couple of small dishes&#x2014;any local specialties, I mean,&#x201d; he said, not really hungry. &#x201c;And a beer.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Three whites are the local specialties,&#x201d; the old man said. &#x201c;The white water fish may be too large for one person. And I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend the white shrimp&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not that fresh today.&#x201d;<br>Chen remembered, from his Wuxi trip with his parents, his father raving about the &#x201c;three whites&#x201d;&#x2014;white shrimp and white water fish were two of them, but he couldn&#x2019;t recall what the third white was. Another local specialty he liked was the Wuxi soup buns,...</p><h2>Dark Prince (Greek Series)</h2><p>The chaos spirit had chosen the child Alexander to be its human host. But Parmenion, most powerful warrior of ancient Greece, had won a small victory over the darkness that sought to rule through Alexander. The boy's soul had not been destroyed by evil, but instead had merged with it -- and now Parmenion aided Alexander in the battle between light and dark that constantly raged within him.<br>But there was another world, where the creatures of Greece's legends still flourished. There, the chaos spirit already ruled, through a demon king. In this Greece, there was a prophecy that a child of great power, the legendary golden child, would come and restore the fading magic of the land to the creatures of myth. The demon king believed also that devouring the heart of this fabled child would give him immortality. He believed Alexander, with the power of the chaos spirit within him, to be that child. And so he called Alexander into his world . . .<br>Only Parmenion, guided by the seeress Derae, his lost love from another life, could hope to save Alexander from the demon king. But who could save the young prince from the chaos spirit that threatened to conquer his soul?</p><p>Reading this sequel to <i>Lion of Macedon</i> is like reading a compressed, accelerated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> crossed with the classic <i>Star Trek</i> episode, "Mirror, Mirror." Preternaturally precocious 4-year-old Alexander is kidnapped by Philippos, a demonic parallel-universe twin of King Philip of Macedon. Philip's strategos (chief general and strategist), Parmenion, and Philip's assassin, Attalus, form an uneasy alliance in order to retrieve Alexander. Passed (by the sorcerer Aristotle) through a portal to Makedones, a world geographically similar to but historically different from their own, they must first find Alexander and then make their way through hostile, enchanted territory inhabited by magical creatures to a rendezvous with Aristotle. But Philip of Macedon isn't the only person who has a twin in this parallel world, and as Parmenion discovers more about Makedones, he finds that the similarities rather than the differences are the most troubling. <p> There are two stories here. First, Alexander's mystic quest for redemption (carried out by the chosen few) and Parmenion and the Spartans' parallel last-ditch battle (fought with ordinary weapons); then, David Gemmell follows Alexander and Parmenion home. Although they have beaten a horrific demon in Makedones, they have yet to face the demons of Macedon: Alexander's life and soul are at stake in another battle against darkness.</p>David Gemmell&#39;s first novel, LEGEND was published in 1984, beginning his acclaimed Drenai saga. He was widely regarded as Britain&#39;s king of heroic fantasy. He died in July 2006.</p><h2>Einstein</h2><p>Einstein was a rebel and nonconformist from boyhood days, and these character traits drove both his life and his science. In this narrative, Walter Isaacson explains how his mind worked and the mysteries of the universe that he discovered.</p><p>As a scientist, Albert Einstein is undoubtedly the most epic among 20th-century thinkers. Albert Einstein as a man, however, has been a much harder portrait to paint, and what we know of him as a husband, father, and friend is fragmentary at best. With <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>, Walter Isaacson (author of the bestselling biographies <i>Benjamin Franklin</i> and <i>Kissinger</i>) brings Einstein's experience of life, love, and intellectual discovery into brilliant focus. The book is the first biography to tackle Einstein's enormous volume of personal correspondence that heretofore had been sealed from the public, and it's hard to imagine another book that could do such a richly textured and complicated life as Einstein's the same thoughtful justice. Isaacson is a master of the form and this latest opus is at once arresting and wonderfully revelatory. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br> <b>Read "The Light-Beam Rider," the first chapter of Walter Isaacson's <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>.</b> <b>Five Questions for Walter Isaacson</b> <br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> What kind of scientific education did you have to give yourself to be able to understand and explain Einstein's ideas?<br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> I've always loved science, and I had a group of great physicists--such as Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, and Murray Gell-Mann--who tutored me, helped me learn the physics, and checked various versions of my book. I also learned the tensor calculus underlying general relativity, but tried to avoid spending too much time on it in the book. I wanted to capture the imaginative beauty of Einstein's scientific leaps, but I hope folks who want to delve more deeply into the science will read Einstein books by such scientists as Abraham Pais, Jeremy Bernstein, Brian Greene, and others.<br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> That Einstein was a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office when he revolutionized our understanding of the physical world has often been treated as ironic or even absurd. But you argue that in many ways his time there fostered his discoveries. Could you explain? <br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> I think he was lucky to be at the patent office rather than serving as an acolyte in the academy trying to please senior professors and teach the conventional wisdom. As a patent examiner, he got to visualize the physical realities underlying scientific concepts. He had a boss who told him to question every premise and assumption. And as Peter Galison shows in <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps</i>, many of the patent applications involved synchronizing clocks using signals that traveled at the speed of light. So with his office-mate Michele Besso as a sounding board, he was primed to make the leap to special relativity.<br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> That time in the patent office makes him sound far more like a practical scientist and tinkerer than the usual image of the wild-haired professor, and more like your previous biographical subject, the multitalented but eminently earthly Benjamin Franklin. Did you see connections between them?<br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> I like writing about creativity, and that's what Franklin and Einstein shared. They also had great curiosity and imagination. But Franklin was a more practical man who was not very theoretical, and Einstein was the opposite in that regard. <br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Of the many legends that have accumulated around Einstein, what did you find to be least true? Most true? <br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> The least true legend is that he failed math as a schoolboy. He was actually great in math, because he could visualize equations. He knew they were nature's brushstrokes for painting her wonders. For example, he could look at Maxwell's equations and marvel at what it would be like to ride alongside a light wave, and he could look at Max Planck's equations about radiation and realize that Planck's constant meant that light was a particle as well as a wave. The most true legend is how rebellious and defiant of authority he was. You see it in his politics, his personal life, and his science.<br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> At <i>Time</i> and CNN and the Aspen Institute, you've worked with many of the leading thinkers and leaders of the day. Now that you've had the chance to get to know Einstein so well, did he remind you of anyone from our day who shares at least some of his remarkable qualities? <br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> There are many creative scientists, most notably Stephen Hawking, who wrote the essay on Einstein as "Person of the Century" when I was editor of <i>Time</i>. In the world of technology, Steve Jobs has the same creative imagination and ability to think differently that distinguished Einstein, and Bill Gates has the same intellectual intensity. I wish I knew politicians who had the creativity and human instincts of Einstein, or for that matter the wise feel for our common values of Benjamin Franklin. <br><br> <p><b>More to Explore</b> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br><i>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</i> </p></td> <td><br><i>Kissinger: A Biography </i></td> <td><br><i>The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made </i></td> </tr></tbody></table>Walter Isaacson, University Professor of History at Tulane, has been CEO of the Aspen Institute, chairman of CNN, and editor of Time magazine.

She lives with her daughter in Melbourne, Australia.THE HOUSE STILL SMELLED OF DEATH.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two months had passed since Mom&#x2019;s murder, but the air still echoed with her agony and I knew if I breathed deep enough, I&#x2019;d catch the hint of old blood.<br> &nbsp;<br> But at least there were no visible reminders. The Directorate&#x2019;s cleanup team had done a good job of removing the evidence.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bile rose up my throat, and I briefly closed my eyes. I&#x2019;d seen her&#x2014;had seen what had been done to her&#x2014;and it haunted me every night in my dreams. But in many ways, those dreams were also responsible for me finally being able to walk through the front door today.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d done enough remembering, and shed enough tears. Now I wanted revenge, and that wasn&#x2019;t going to happen if I waited for others to hunt down the killers. No, I needed to be a part of it. I needed to do something to help ease the ferocity of the dreams&#x2014;dreams that came from the guilty knowledge that I should have been there for her. That if I had, I might have been able to prevent this.<br> &nbsp;<br> I drew in a deep breath that did little to steady the almost automatic wash of fury, and discovered something else. Her scent still lingered.<br> &nbsp;<br> And not just her scent. Everything she&#x2019;d been, and everything she&#x2019;d done&#x2014;all her love and energy and compassion&#x2014;filled this place with a warmth that still radiated from the very walls.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the first time since I&#x2019;d scattered her ashes in the hills that she&#x2019;d loved, I smiled.<br> &nbsp;<br> She would never entirely be gone from this world. She&#x2019;d done too much, and helped too many people, for her memory to be erased completely.<br> &nbsp;<br> And that was one hell of a legacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, despite the echoes of the warmth and love that had once filled these rooms, I had no intention of keeping the house. Not when all I had to do was step into the kitchen to be reminded of everything that had happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> I walked along the hallway, my boots echoing on the polished marble floor. Aside from the few items of furniture placed to give prospective buyers an idea of each room&#x2019;s size and purpose, the house was empty. Mike&#x2014;who&#x2019;d been Mom&#x2019;s financial adviser and was still mine&#x2014;had made all the arrangements, talking to the real estate people on my behalf and shifting most of the furniture into storage so I could deal with it later. Only the items in the two safes remained untouched, and that was a task only I could handle&#x2014;although it was the one thing I&#x2019;d been avoiding until now.<br> &nbsp;<br> I drew in a shuddery breath, then slowly climbed the carpeted stairs. Once I reached the landing, I headed for Mom&#x2019;s bedroom down at the far end of the hall. The air had a disused smell. Maybe the people employed to keep the house spotless until it sold hadn&#x2019;t been as generous with the deodorizer up here.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the soft hint of oranges and sunshine teased my nostrils as I walked into Mom&#x2019;s bedroom, and just for a moment it felt like she was standing beside me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Which was silly, because she&#x2019;d long since moved on, but my fingers still twitched with the urge to reach for her.<br> &nbsp;<br> I walked across the thick carpet and opened the double doors to her wardrobe. Her clothes had already been donated to charity, but somehow seeing this emptiness hit me in a way that the emptiness of the other rooms had not. I&#x2019;d often played in here as a kid, dressing up in her silkiest gowns and smearing my face&#x2014;and no doubt said gowns&#x2014;with her makeup.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d never once been angry. She&#x2019;d always laughed and joined the fun, even letting me do her face.<br> &nbsp;<br> I swiped at the tear that appeared on my cheek and resolutely walked into the bathroom. Most people wouldn&#x2019;t think of looking for a safe in an en suite, which is exactly why Mom had installed her second one here. This was where she&#x2019;d stored her most precious jewelry.<br> &nbsp;<br> I opened the double doors under the basin and ducked down. The safe was embedded in the wall and visible only because all of Mom&#x2019;s makeup had been cleared away.<br> &nbsp;<br> After typing in the code, I pressed my hand against the reader. Red light flickered across my fingertips; then there was a soft click as the safe opened.<br> &nbsp;<br> I took a deep breath, then sat and pulled the door all the way open. Inside were all her favorite items, including the chunky jade bracelet she&#x2019;d bought the last time she was in New Zealand, only a few weeks before her death. There was also a stack of Microdrive photo disks and, finally, an envelope.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was nothing written on the front of the envelope, but faint wisps of orange teased my nostrils as I flipped it over and slid a nail along the edge to open it. Inside was a folded piece of paper that smelled of Mom. I took another, somewhat shaky breath and opened it.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m sorry that I had to leave you in the dark, my darling daughter, it said, and I could almost imagine her saying the words as I read them. Could almost feel her warm breath stirring the hair near my cheek. But I was given little other choice. Besides, I saw my death long ago and knew it was the price I had to pay for having you. I never regretted my choice&#x2014;not then, and most certainly not now, when that death is at my doorstep. Don&#x2019;t ever think I accepted my fate placidly. I didn&#x2019;t. But the cosmos could show me no way out that didn&#x2019;t also involve your death or Riley&#x2019;s. Or worse, both of you. In the end, it just had to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Live long, love well, and I will see you in the next life. I love you always. Mom.<br> &nbsp;<br> I closed my eyes against the sting of tears. Damn it, I wouldn&#x2019;t cry again. I wouldn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> But my tear ducts weren&#x2019;t taking any notice.<br> &nbsp;<br> I swiped at the moisture, then sat back on my heels. Oddly enough, I almost felt better. At least now I knew why she&#x2019;d refused to tell me what was going on. She&#x2019;d seen my death&#x2014;and Riley&#x2019;s&#x2014;if we&#x2019;d intervened. And I would have intervened. I mean, she was my mother.<br> &nbsp;<br> And as a result, I&#x2019;d have died.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her death still hurt&#x2014;would always hurt&#x2014;but a tiny weight seemed to have lifted from my soul.<br> &nbsp;<br> I glanced down at the letter in my hand, smiling slightly as her scent spun around me, then folded it up again and tucked it into my pocket. That one piece of paper was worth more than anything else in her safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> I scooped up the remainder of the jewels, but as I rose, awareness washed over me. Someone&#x2014;or something&#x2014;was in the house.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was half werewolf, and my senses were keen. Though I hadn&#x2019;t actually locked the front door, I doubted any humans could have entered without me hearing. Humans tended to walk heavily, even when they were trying to sneak, and with the house almost empty the sound would have echoed. But this invader was as silent as a ghost. And it wasn&#x2019;t nonhuman, either, because in the midst of awareness came a wash of heat&#x2014;not body heat, but rather the heat of a powerful presence.<br> &nbsp;<br> An Aedh.<br> &nbsp;<br> And he was in spirit form rather than physical.<br> &nbsp;<br> My pulse skipped, then raced. The last time I&#x2019;d felt something like this, I&#x2019;d been in the presence of my father. Of course, that meeting had ended when two Aedh priests had gate-crashed the party in an effort to capture my father&#x2014;who&#x2019;d fled and left me to fight the priests off alone. Needless to say, the odds had been on their side, and I&#x2019;d been taken and tortured for information. And while my father might not have led me into the trap, he still bore some responsibility for it. It was him they wanted, not me.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hell, everyone wanted him. The Directorate of Other Races, the vampire council, and the reapers.<br> &nbsp;<br> And they all were intent on using me to get to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Which pissed me off no end, but there wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot I could do about it. Especially given the deal I&#x2019;d made with Madeline Hunter&#x2014;the woman who was not only in charge of the Directorate, but also one of the highest-ranking members of the vampire council. Of course, she had managed to catch me at a vulnerable moment. She&#x2019;d arrived uninvited as I said my final good-bye to Mom, had heard my vow for vengeance, and had all but blackmailed me into becoming an adviser to the council. In exchange, they would throw their full resources behind finding Mom&#x2019;s killer.<br> &nbsp;<br> I hadn&#x2019;t walked away from the deal yet&#x2014;not when finding Mom&#x2019;s killer might well depend on the information the council could give me. They might be using me to get to my dad, but I sure as hell intended to return the favor.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Book Of Hygge</h2><p>Book of Hygge</p><p></p><h2>Traitors Gate: A Charlotte and Thomas Pitt Novel</h2><p><p>Someone in the Colonial Office is passing secrets to Germany about England&#x2019;s strategy on Africa.

Echoing the paradox of the Infinite localized and the Eternal timebound, this provocation remains ever-present in the world in the intertwoven mysteries of the visible Catholic Church, the Most Blessed Sacrament at her heart, and the papacy as her earthly head.</p><p>In this stirring and often surprising collection of essays, award-winning German novelist Martin Mosebach confronts the reader with Catholicism&#x2019;s correctives to regionalism and the tyranny of fashion. He shows us how the great wonder and beauty of the traditional form of the Mass leads us to appreciate and recover our childlike faith in the Real Presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. He explains why popular devotion to Our Lady, in spite of the kitsch that often surrounds it, is more vital, permanent, and world-changing than mountains of learned discourse or political messianism. Resting on the rock of dogmatic confession rather than the shifting sands of journalistic opinion, Mosebach exalts the Christ-given office of the papacy and diminishes its recent man-made agendas.</p><p>These records of pilgrimage and reflection bear witness to the perennially &#x201c;subversive&#x201d; nature of full-blooded Catholicism, which challenges the assumptions not only of those outside the fold, but perhaps even more, of those within it who exchange their birthright of holy and heavenly mysteries for a mess of modern pottage.

The stories we encounter about the environment in popular culture too often promote an imagined moral economy, assuring us that tiny acts of voluntary personal piety, such as recycling a coffee cup, or purchasing green consumer items, can offset our destructive habits. No need to make any fundamental structural changes. The trick is simply for the consumer to buy the right things and shop our way to a greener future.</p><p>It&#x2019;s time for a reality check. Ecopiety offers an absorbing examination of the intersections of environmental sensibilities, contemporary expressions of piety and devotion, and American popular culture. Ranging from portrayals of environmental sin and virtue such as the eco-pious depiction of Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey, to the green capitalism found in the world of mobile-device &#x201c;carbon sin-tracking&#x201d; software applications, to the socially conscious vegetarian vampires in True Blood, the volume illuminates the work pop culture performs as both a mirror and an engine for the greening of American spiritual and ethical commitments. </p><p>Taylor makes the case that it is not through a framework of grim duty or obligation, but through one of play and delight, that we may move environmental ideals into substantive action.</p></p><p><b>Sarah McFarland Taylor</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of Religious Studies and in the Program in Environmental Policy and Culture at Northwestern University.

(Publishers Weekly)<br><br>"This book could not come at a more urgent time; as the costs of human life and consumerism become clearer in the environmental crises of the planet, MacFarland-Taylor offers us a brilliant, compelling analysis of how discourses of virtue are used to re-direct the global climate crisis from a collective politics to the choices of individual consumers. The book explores green consumer marketing in the frame of ecopiety by examining a variety of practices, from cars to reality television to mediated popular cultural narratives about vampires to green burials, and in the process offers not only a trenchant critique but also possible alternatives to individualist consumption as a way to virtuously &#x201c;save the planet.&#x201d;" (Sarah Banet-Weiser, London School of Economics and author of Empowered: Popular Feminism and Popular Misogyny <i>Sarah Banet-Weiser, London School of Economics and author of Empowered: Popular Feminism and Popular Misogyny</i>)</p><h2>Funny Stories For 7 Year Olds</h2><p><p>This bright and varied selection of wonderfully entertaining stories by some of the very best writers for children is erfect for reading alone or aloud&#x2014;and for dipping into time and time again.

Schelling&#x2019;s <i>Weltalter</i> drafts belong to this same series, with their repeated attempt at the formulation of the &#x2018;beginning of the world,&#x2019; of the passage from the pre-symbolic pulsation of the Real to the universe of logos.<br><br>F.W.J. Schelling, the German idealist who for too long dwelled in the shadow of Kant and Hegel, was the first to formulate the post-idealist motifs of finitude, contingency and temporality. His unique work announces Marx&#x2019;s critique of speculative idealism, as well as the properly Freudian notion of drive, of a blind compulsion to repeat which can never be sublated in the ideal medium of language.<br><br><i>The Indivisible Remainder </i>begins with a detailed examination of the two works in which Schelling&#x2019;s speculative audacity reached its peak: his essay on human freedom and his drafts on the &#x201c;Ages of the World.&#x201d; After reconstituting their line of argumentation, Slavoj i ek confronts Schelling with Hegel, and concludes by throwing a Schellingian light on some &#x201c;related matters&#x201d;: the consequences of the computerization of daily life for sexual experience; cynicism as today&#x2019;s predominant form of ideology; the epistemological deadlocks of quantum physics.<br><br>Although the book is packed with examples from politics and popular culture &#x2014; the unmistakable token of i ek&#x2019;s style &#x2014; from <i>Speed</i> and <i>Groundhog Day</i> to <i>Forrest Gump,</i> it signals a major shift towards a systematic concern with the basic questions of philosophy and the roots of the crisis of our late-capitalist universe, centred around the enigma of modern subjectivity.</p><p><b>Slavoj &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</b> is a Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic.

Youth and productivity are celebrated in today's society, while the elderly are increasingly marginalized.

In a full-orbed discussion of the subject, eighteen first-rate Christian thinkers survey biblical and historical perspectives on aging, look at aging in the modern world, and describe the "Christian practice of growing old." Along the way they address many timely issues, including the medicalization of aging, the debate over physician-assisted suicide, and the importance of friendships both among the elderly and between the elderly and the young.<br><br>Weighty enough to instruct theologians, ethicists, and professional caregivers yet accessible enough for pastors and general readers, this book will benefit anyone seeking faith-based insight into growing old.<br><br><b>Contributors</b>:<br>David Aers<br>David Cloutier<br>Rowan A.

Her Los Angeles was made up of stucco tenements, welfare, and the marginalized. It wasn't a destination city, it was the end of the line. </p><p><i>Frantic Transmissions to and from Los Angeles</i> chronicles the trajectory of Braverman's Left Coast generation with a voice of singular power. She was an antiwar activist in Berkeley, a punk-rock poet on Sunset Strip, a single mother in the East L.A. barrio, and a woman in recovery at AA meetings in Beverly Hills. By 1990 she was married and settled into a life of writing and teaching. In her forties, Braverman did the unthinkable and moved from Beverly Hills to New York's Allegheny Mountains to a 150-year-old farmhouse. </p><p>In wide-ranging transmissions, Braverman deftly contrasts the social histories of Los Angeles with her new, timeless rural community; describes the effects of the changing seasons on her Californian, sun-drenched soul; and marvels at how a remote farmhouse can offer surprising consolations. </p><p><i>Library Journal</i> calls Braverman a "literary genius"; <i>Rolling Stone</i> describes her as having the "power and intensity you don't see much outside of rock and roll." <i>Frantic Transmissions to and from Los Angeles</i> offers an eccentric and insightful view of social and individual transformation.</p></p><p><p><b>Kate Braverman</b> is the author of several works of fiction and poetry, most recently, <i>The Incantation of Frida K</i>. She currently lives with her husband in San Francisco.</p>Experimental poet and novelist Braverman (<i>The Incantation of Frida K.</i>) proffers a brash, witty memoir comprising a dozen bubbling, occasionally repetitive essays chronicling her 1990s move from L.A. to an upstate New York farmhouse. After the last spate of riots and a major earthquake, the 40-something Braverman decides to quit the city of her birth and head to the Allegheny Mountains to live through brutal winters with her husband, an academic scientist, and teenage daughter. In the first and funniest essay, Braverman relates how a longtime denizen of L.A. like herself manages to leave, an ordeal in itself: "Such a departure requires magical intervention." Then she is prey to advice from others, such as Uncle Irving, who gives the lowdown on their Jewish family's desperate emigration from the Old World: "They couldn't even invent a past with a single exception to impoverishment." In six "Transmission" essays, Braverman delineates her thorny new eastern habitat, where she enjoys four bathrooms, gardening and "active correspondence necessitating pens and the postal service"; with snow falling for eight consecutive months, she even craves the crass fantasyland of L.A. malls. In fact, once removed from that city's crime and materialism, Braverman finds she can draw in sharp relief its "accumulated atrocities." <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At a time when most roads were unpaved and horse and buggy travel were costly and difficult, these streetcar-like electric cars were essential to economic growth. But why did interurban fever strike so suddenly and extensively in the Midwest and other areas? Why did thousands of people withdraw their savings to get onto what they believed to be a "gravy train?" How did officials of competing steam railroads respond to these challenges to their operations? H. Roger Grant explores the rise and fall of this fleeting form of transportation that started in the early 1900s and was defunct just 30 years later. Perfect for railfans,<i> Electric Interurbans and the American People</i> is a comprehensive contribution for those who love the flanged wheel.</p></p><p><p>H. Roger Grant is Kathryn and Calhoun Lemon Professor of History at Clemson University. He is author of more than 30 books, including <i>Railroaders without Borders: A History of the Railroad Development Corporation</i> (IUP, 2015), <i>The Louisville, Cincinnati &amp; Charleston Rail Road: Dreams of Linking North and South</i> (IUP, 2014), and <i>Railroads and the American People</i> (IUP, 2012).</p><p>"</p><p>"Grant carefully provides specific examples from his broad knowledge of transportation history to support any assertions made in his text material.

Heather has found a new friend, out in the graveyard behind our home -- a girl named Helen who died with her family in a mysterious fire over a hundred years ago. Now her ghost returns to lure children into the pond...to drown! I don't want to believe in ghosts, but I've followed Heather into the graveyard and watch her talk to Helen. And I'm terrified.

An avid reader, traveler, and all-around arts lover, Ms. Hahn lives in Columbia, Maryland, with her two cats, Oscar and Rufus.Molly and Michael have a difficult time adjusting to their spoiled new stepsister, Heather. Ellen Grafton perfectly captures the selfish, manipulative Heather and the disgusted responses of her stepsiblings. Their parents, hopeful that the family will come together with a move to the country, find a home next to a graveyard--a graveyard with a ghost who leads young girls into a watery grave. As Heather fights to pull the family apart and makes an alliance with the ghost, Grafton&#39;s reading hints at her inner struggle. The strength of Grafton&#39;s narration is the power she gives to the many strained family interactions. These create a listening tension that mounts to a taut conclusion as Molly fights to save the tormented Heather from the ghost.

Index.<br></p><p>An intellectual tour-de-force, <i>Forbidden Knowledge</i> is a study of the ethics of literary and scientific inquiry. Shattuck first approaches his subject indirectly, conducting an engaging tour of Western literature: Adam and Eve, Prometheus, Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Goethe's <i>Faust</i>, and Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>. He then uses these tales to address the moral questions raised by mankind's tendency to search for dangerous knowledge. He contrasts J. Robert Oppenheimer's acceptance of guilt for the atomic bombings with Edward Teller's dismissal of the same. In his own field of literary criticism he argues against the neutral analysis of immoral works as "pure literature," illustrating his point with a critique of the Marquis de Sade. <i>Forbidden Knowledge</i> is a stimulating and forceful intellectual argument against moral relativism, as well as a practical approach to difficult ethical problems, from genetic engineering to pornography.Mr. Roger Shattuck's scholarly contributions included writing three books on Marcel Proust, one of which won a National Book Award in 1975. His intellectual journey included a groundbreaking work on the rise of the avant-garde in France in the decades preceding World War I and a provocative examination of the famed "Wild Boy of Aveyron" as a study of how humans develop intelligence.

Drawing on the latest research from anthropology to neuroscience and her own field experience, she argues that the biggest challenge to human survival isn't our fossil fuel dependency, melting glaciers, or other calamities. Rather, it's our faulty way of thinking about these environmental crises that robs us of power. Lapp� dismantles seven common thought traps&#x201d; from limits to growth to the failings of democracy that belie what we now know about nature, including our own, and offers contrasting thought leaps&#x201d; that reveal our hidden power.<p> Like her <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i> classic, <i>EcoMind</i> is challenging, controversial and empowering.</p></p><p><b>Frances Moore Lappe</b> is the author of 17 books and cofounder of Food First: The Institute for Food and Development Policy, the Small Planet Institute, and the Small Planet Fund.

Michael Garrick loves his job as deputy counsel, but when he falls for Nora Hartson, the president's daughter, the conflict between his professional ethics and his growing love for her puts him right in the middle of a murder plot that may reach all the way to the Oval Office. <p> Meltzer excels at plotting, and he knows the back corridors, family quarters, and secret tunnels of the executive branch as well as those of the Supreme Court, which he revealed in his first two blockbusters. He's not as skillful at characterization. It's hard to believe that the sociopathic tendencies of people in a president's inner circle--or even his family--would have managed to escape the scrutiny of an FBI investigation during his rise to power. And Nora, in particular, doesn't quite come off as the misguided victim she must be in order to make the rest of the story credible. But that's not a huge quibble; Meltzer manages to make Edgar Simon, Michael's boss, the most interesting White House counsel since John Dean. <i>The First Counsel</i> is a cleverly commercial mix of legal thriller and political chicanery guaranteed to keep you turning pages until Meltzer puts the third branch of government in his sights, too. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Arrangement: Number 2 in series (Survivors&#39; Club)</h2><p><p><b>A mesmerising story of passionate awakening and redemption, Mary Balogh's new novel unites a war hero consigned to darkness with a remarkable woman who finds her own salvation by showing him the light of love.</b></p><p>Blinded by a cannon blast on the Napoleonic battlefields, Vincent Hunt, Lord Darleigh, needs time away from the well-meaning meddling - and matchmaking - of his family.

But the simple fact was that he bolted.<br><br>He took with him his valet, Martin Fisk; his traveling carriage and horses; and enough clothes and other necessary belongings to last him a month or two&#x2014;or six. He really did not know how long he would stay away. He took his violin too after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation. His friends liked to tease him about it and affect horror every time he tucked it beneath his chin, but he thought he played it tolerably well. More important, he liked playing it. It soothed his soul, though he never confided that thought to his friends. Flavian would no doubt make a comment along the lines of its scratching the boot soles of everyone else who happened to be within earshot.<br><br>The main trouble with home was that he was afflicted with too many female relatives and not enough male ones&#x2014;and no assertive males. His grandmother and his mother lived with him, and his three sisters, though married with homes and families of their own, came to stay all too frequently, and often for lengthy spells. Hardly a month went by without at least one of them being in residence for a few days or a week or more. His brothers-in-law, when they came with their wives&#x2014;which was not every time&#x2014;tactfully held themselves aloof from Vincent&#x2019;s affairs and allowed their womenfolk to rule his life, even though it was worthy of note that none of them allowed their wives to rule theirs.<br><br>It all would have been understandable, even under ordinary circumstances, Vincent supposed grudgingly. He was, after all, everyone&#x2019;s only grandson or only son or only brother&#x2014;and younger brother at that&#x2014;and as such was fair game to be protected and cosseted and worried over and planned for. He had inherited his title and fortune just four years ago, at the age of nineteen, from an uncle who had been robust and only forty-six years old when he died and who had had a son as sturdy and fit as he. They had both died violently. Life was a fragile business and so was the inheritance, Vincent&#x2019;s female relatives were fond of observing. It behooved him, therefore, to fill his nursery with an heir and a number of spares as soon as was humanly possible. It was irrelevant that he was still very young and would not even have begun to think of matrimony yet, left to himself. His family knew all they cared to know about living in genteel poverty.<br><br>His were not ordinary circumstances, however, and as a result, his relatives clucked about him like a flock of mother hens all intent upon nurturing the same frail chick while somehow avoiding smothering it. His mother had moved to Middlebury Park in Gloucestershire even before he did. She had got it ready for him. His maternal grandmother had let the lease expire on her house in Bath and joined his mother there. And after he moved in, three years ago, his sisters began to find Middlebury the most fascinating place on earth to be. And Vincent need not worry about their husbands feeling neglected, they had collectively assured him. Their husbands understood. The word was always spoken with something like hushed reverence.<br><br>In fact, most of what they all said to him was spoken in much the same manner, as though he were some sort of precious but mentally deficient child.<br><br>This year they had begun to talk pointedly about marriage. His marriage, that was. Even apart from the succession issue, marriage would bring him comfort and companionship, they had decided, and all kinds of other assorted benefits. Marriage would enable them to relax and worry less about him. It would enable his grandmother to return to Bath, which she was missing. And it would not be at all difficult to find a lady willing and even eager to marry him. He must not imagine it would be. He was titled and wealthy, after all. And he had youth and looks and charm. There were hordes of ladies out there who would understand and actually be quite happy to marry him. They would quickly learn to love him for himself. At least, one would, the one he would choose. And they, his female relatives, would help him make that choice, of course. That went without saying, though they said it anyway.<br><br>The campaign had started over Easter, when the whole family was at Middlebury, his sisters&#x2019; husbands and their children included. Vincent himself had just returned from Penderris Hall in Cornwall, country seat of the Duke of Stanbrook, where he spent a few weeks of each year with his fellow members of the self-styled Survivors&#x2019; Club, a group of survivors of the Napoleonic Wars, and he had been feeling a little bereft, as he always did for a while after parting from those dearest friends in the world. He had let the women talk without paying a great deal of attention or even thinking of perhaps putting his foot down.<br><br>It had proved to be a mistake.<br><br>Only a month after Easter his sisters and brothers-in-law and nieces and nephews had returned en masse, to be followed a day or so later by houseguests. It was still only spring and an odd time of year for a house party, when the social Season in London would be just getting into full swing. But this was not really a party, Vincent had soon discovered, for the only guests who were not also family were Mr. Geoffrey Dean, son of Grand�mama&#x2019;s dearest friend in Bath, his wife, and their three daughters. Their two sons were away at school. Two of the daughters were still in the schoolroom&#x2014;their governess had been brought with them. But the eldest, Miss Philippa Dean, was almost nineteen and had made her curtsy to the queen just a couple of weeks before and secured partners for every set at her come-out ball. She had made a very satisfactory debut indeed into polite society.<br><br>But, Mrs. Dean was hasty to add while describing her daughter&#x2019;s triumph over tea soon after their arrival at Middlebury Park, how could they possibly have resisted the prospect of spending a quiet couple of weeks in the country with old friends?<br><br>Old friends?<br><br>The situation had soon become painfully clear to Vincent, though no one bothered to explain. Miss Phi�lippa Dean was on the marriage mart to the highest bidder. She had younger sisters growing up behind her and two brothers at school who might conceivably wish to continue their studies at university. It seemed unlikely that the Deans were vastly wealthy. They had come, then, on the clear understanding that there was a husband to be had for the girl at Middlebury and that she would return to London with all the distinction of being betrothed within a month of her come-out. It would be a singular triumph, especially as she would be securing a husband who was both wealthy and titled.<br><br>And who also happened to be blind.<br><br>Miss Dean was exquisitely lovely, his mother reported, with blond hair and green eyes and a trim figure. Not that her looks mattered to him. She sounded like a sweet and amiable girl.<br><br>She also sounded quite sensible when in conversation with everyone except Vincent himself. She often was in conversation with him during the following few days, however. Every other female in the house, with the possible exception of Vincent&#x2019;s three young nieces, did everything in her power to throw the two of them together and to leave them together. Even a blind man could see that.<br><br>She conversed with him upon trivialities in a gentle, somewhat breathless voice, as though she were in a sickroom and the patient hung precariously between death and life. Whenever Vincent tried to steer the conversation to some meaningful topic in order to discover something of her interests and opinions and the quality of her mind, she invariably agreed wholeheartedly with everything he said, even to the point of absurdity.<br><br>&#x201c;I am firmly of the opinion,&#x201d; he said to her one afternoon when they were sitting together in the formal parterre gardens before the house despite a rather strong breeze, &#x201c;that the scientific world has been in a wicked conspiracy against the masses for the past number of centuries, Miss Dean, in order to convince us that the earth is round. It is, of course, quite undeniably flat. Even a fool could see that. If one were to walk to the edge of it, one would fall off and never be heard of again. What is your opinion?&#x201d;<br><br>It was unkind. It was a bit mean.<br><br>She was silent for several moments, while he willed her to contradict him. Or laugh at him. Or call him an idiot. Her voice was gentler than ever when she spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;I am quite sure you have the right of it, my lord,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>He almost said &#x201c;Balderdash!&#x201d; but did not. He would not add cruelty to unkindness. He merely smiled and felt ashamed of himself and talked about the blustery wind.<br><br>And then he felt the fingers of one of her hands on his sleeve, and he could smell her light floral perfume more clearly, an indication that she had leaned closer, and she spoke again&#x2014;in a sweet, hurried, breathless voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I did not at all mind coming here, you know, Lord Darleigh,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;even though I have been looking forward forever to my first Season in London and do not remember ever being happier than I was on the night of my come-out ball. But I know enough about life to understand that I was taken there not just for enjoyment. Mama and Papa have explained what a wonderful opportunity this invitation is for me, as well as for my sisters and brothers. I did not mind coming, truly. Indeed, I came willingly. I understand, you see, and I will not mind one little bit.&#x201d;<br><br>Her fingers squeezed his arm before letting it go.<br><br>&#x201c;You will think I am forward,&#x201d; she added, &#x201c;though I am not usually so outspoken. I just thought you needed to know that I do not mind. For perhaps you fear I do.&#x201d;<br><br>It was one of the most excruciatingly embarrassing moments of Vincent&#x2019;s life, as well as being almost insufferably infuriating. Not that she infuriated him, poor girl. But her parents did, and his mother and grandmother and sisters did. It was quite obvious to him that Miss Dean had been brought here not just as an eligible young lady whom he might get to know with the possibility on both their parts of deepening their acquaintance in the future if they liked each other. No, she had been brought here fully expecting that he would make her an offer before she left. Pressure would have been brought to bear by her parents, but she was a dutiful daughter, it seemed, and accepted her responsibility as the eldest. She would marry him even though he was blind.<br><br>She very obviously did mind.<br><br>He was angry with his mother and sisters for assuming that mental deficiency was one effect of blindness. He had known they wished him to marry soon. He had known that they would proceed to matchmake for him. What he had not known was that they would choose his bride without a word to him and then practically force him into accepting their choice&#x2014;and in his own home, moreover.<br><br>His house, in fact, was not his own home&#x2014;that realization came like an epiphany. It never had been. Whose fault that was must be examined at some future date. It was tempting to blame his relatives, but . . . Well, he would have to think the whole matter over.<br><br>He had a niggling suspicion, though, that if he was not master here, the fault lay with him.<br><br>But for now he was in an impossible situation. He felt no spark of attraction toward Miss Dean, even though he believed he would very probably like her under different circumstances. It was clear she felt nothing for him but the obligation to marry him. He could not, though, allow both of them to be coerced into doing what neither of them wanted to do.<br><br>As soon as they had returned indoors&#x2014;Miss Dean took his offered arm and then proceeded to steer him along with gentle but firm intent even though he had his cane with him and knew the way perfectly well without any assistance at all&#x2014;Vincent went to his private sitting room&#x2014;the only place in the house where he could be assured of being alone and of being himself&#x2014;and summoned Martin Fisk.<br><br>&#x201c;We are going,&#x201d; he said abruptly when his valet arrived.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we, sir?&#x201d; Martin asked cheerfully. &#x201c;And what clothes will you be needing for the occasion?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will need everything that will fit into the trunk I always take to Penderris,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;You will doubtless decide for yourself what you need.&#x201d;<br><br>A low grunt was followed by silence.<br><br>&#x201c;I am feeling especially stupid today,&#x201d; Martin said. &#x201c;You had better explain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are going,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;Leaving. Putting as much distance between us and Middlebury as we possibly can in order to evade pursuit. Slinking off. Running away. Taking the coward&#x2019;s way out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The lady does not suit, does she?&#x201d; Martin asked.<br><br>Ha! Even Martin knew why the girl had been brought here.<br><br>&#x201c;Not as a wife,&#x201d; Vincent told him. &#x201c;Not as my wife, anyway. Good Lord, Martin, I do not even want to marry. Not yet. And if and when I do want it, I shall choose the lady myself. Very carefully. And I shall make sure that if she says yes, it is not simply because she understands and will not mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; Martin said. &#x201c;That is what this one said, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With the softest, gentlest sweetness,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;She is sweet and gentle, actually. She is prepared to make a martyr of herself for the sake of her family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we are running away where?&#x201d; Martin asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Anywhere on earth but here,&#x201d; Vincent said. &#x201c;Can we leave tonight? Without anyone&#x2019;s knowing?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I grew up at a smithy,&#x201d; Martin reminded him. &#x201c;I think I could manage to attach the horses to the carriage without getting the lines hopelessly tangled up. But presumably I won&#x2019;t have to risk it. I suppose you will want Handry to drive us? I&#x2019;ll have a word with him. He knows how to keep his lips sealed. Two o&#x2019;clock in the morning, shall we say? I&#x2019;ll come and carry your trunk out and then come back to dress you. We should be well on our way by three.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Vincent said.<br><br>They were about one mile on their way when Martin, occupying the seat opposite Vincent&#x2019;s in the carriage, his back to the horses, reported that it was three o&#x2019;clock.<br><br>Vincent refused to feel guilty&#x2014;and of course was consumed by nothing but guilt. And by the conviction that he was the world&#x2019;s worst cad and coward, not to mention worst son and brother and grandson. And gentleman. But really, what else could he have done, short of marrying Miss Philippa Dean or publicly humiliating her?<br><br>But would she not be equally humiliated to learn that he had fled?<br><br>Arrghh!<br><br>He chose to believe that behind any momentary humiliation she might feel would be an enormous relief. He was sure she would be relieved, poor girl.<br><br>They went to the Lake District and spent three blissful weeks there. It was reputed to be one of the loveliest parts of England, though much of its beauty was lost on a blind man, of course. Not all of it, however. There were country lanes to stroll along, many of them parallel to the banks of Lake Windermere or some other, lesser lakes. There were hills to climb, some of them requiring strenuous effort&#x2014;and stronger winds and more rarefied air as a reward when they climbed high. There was rain and sunshine and chill and warmth, all the wonderful variety of English weather and countryside. There was a boat ride, on which he could pull the oars himself, and horse rides&#x2014;with Martin at his side but never touching him. There was even one glorious gallop across flat land, which, in Martin&#x2019;s careful estimation, did ...</p><h2>Gaming Representation: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Video Games (Digital Game Studies)</h2><p><p>Recent years have seen an increase in public attention to identity and representation in video games, including journalists and bloggers holding the digital game industry accountable for the discrimination routinely endured by female gamers, queer gamers, and gamers of color. Video game developers are responding to these critiques, but scholarly discussion of representation in games has lagged far behind. <i>Gaming Representation</i> examines portrayals of race, gender, and sexuality in a range of games, from casuals like Diner Dash, to indies like Journey and The Binding of Isaac, to mainstream games from the Grand Theft Auto, BioShock, Spec Ops, The Last of Us, and Max Payne franchises. Arguing that representation and identity function as systems in games that share a stronger connection to code and platforms than it may first appear, the contributors to this volume push gaming scholarship to new levels of inquiry, theorizing, and imagination.</p></p><p><p>Jennifer Malkowski is Assistant Professor of Film and Media Studies at Smith College.

Traditional religions that had informed the worldviews of Africans were transported to the shores of the Americas and transformed to make sense of new contexts and conditions. This book explores the survival of traditional religions and how African American religions have influenced and been shaped by American religious history. The text provides an overview of the central people, issues, and events in an account that considers Protestant denominations, Catholicism, Islam, Pentecostal churches, Voodoo, Conjure, Rastafarianism, and new religious movements such as Black Judaism, the Nation of Islam, and the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors. The book addresses contemporary controversies, including President Barack Obama&#39;s former pastor Jeremiah Wright, and it will be valuable to all students of African American religions, African American studies, sociology of religion, American religious history, the Black Church, and black theology.</p><p>Julius H. Bailey is professor of religious studies at the University of Redlands in California. He earned a PhD in religious studies from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and is the author of Race Patriotism: Protest and Print Culture in the A.M.E.Church (2020).<p>"This extraordinary treatment of African American religions introduces pivotal themes in the historical formation of African American religions. <i>Down in the Valley</i> elucidates a sweeping range of religious movements while attending to the larger context of social structures at work in the United States. Through skillful interpretation and a creative display of scholarly knowledge, Julius Bailey has written an exceptional book that transcends the restrictive paradigm of the Black Church to examine Black religions up to the twenty-first century. Bailey's path-breaking volume will reshape the way students and scholars understand African American religions." --Sylvester A. Johnson, Northwestern University,/p&gt;</p><p>"From African traditional religions through Barack Obama's former pastor Jeremiah Wright, this lively introduction to African American religions reliably informs and enlightens its readers. The full variety of African American religions is clearly and concisely explained here. This may well become the standard text on African American religious history."</p> --Stephen W. Angell, Earlham School of Religion<br><br>"In this engaging and accessible study, Julius Bailey offers a rich portrait of African American religious life. Providing an efficient and yet detailed account of the significance of Christianity and black churches, Bailey's text also provides readers with a sense of the variety and creativity of African American religious life and highlights a range of political and social issues that shape and challenge black religious communities. It is an enormously useful introduction to the field." --Judith Weisenfeld, Princeton University<br><br>"Julius Bailey's probing look at African Americans and religion demonstrates how communities have interwoven ideological and material aspects of religion in ways that conserve and enrich tradition, even while black new religious movements have emerged throughout American history to challenge those traditions. This is a fascinating, rewarding, and eminently readable overview." --John Corrigan, Florida State University</p><h2>Empire (A Jack Sigler Thriller)</h2><p>WHEN PAST AND PRESENT COLLIDE...

In 2003 he realized the work �First Light� for the art and exhibition space of the Louis Vuitton branch in Omotesando.

Pressing critically on the politics of visibility and recognition and how this categorization reduces artworks by Asian American artists within narrow parameters of interpretation, <em>Unnamable </em>reconceives Asian American art not as a subset of objects, but as a discursive medium that sets up the conditions for a politics to occur. By approaching Asian American art in this way, Min refigures the way we see Asian American art as an oppositional practice, less in terms of its aspirations to be seen&#x2014;its greater visibility&#x2014;and more in terms of how it models a different way of seeing and encountering the world.&nbsp;Uniquely presented, the chapters are organized thematically as mini-exhibitions, and offer readings of select works by contemporary artists including Tehching Hsieh, Byron Kim, Simon Leung, Mary Lum, and Nikki S. Lee. Inspired above all by their art practice, Min argues for an alternative approach to exhibition making and methods of reading that conceives of these works not as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d;instances of Asian American art, but as engaged in an aesthetic practice that remains open-ended, challenging the assumptions that racialize artists within an &#x201c;Asian American&#x201d; context . Ultimately, <em>Unnamable </em>insists that in order to reassess Asian American art and beyond its place in art history, we may need to let go not only of established viewing and curatorial practices, but potentially even the category of Asian American art itself as we know it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><p><strong>Susette Min<em> </em></strong>is Associate Professor at the University of California, Davis, where she teaches Asian American studies, art history, curatorial studies, and cultural studies. She is also an independent curator.</p>&#x201c;In her exquisitely perceptive approach to art and curation, Susette Min turns the category of Asian American art on its head. The artists surveyed in&nbsp;<em>Unnamable</em>&nbsp;wrestle with the &#x2018;predicament&#x2019; of being categorized as an Asian American artist. Through textured, impeccably-researched, and richly-rendered examinations of their works, Min curates these avant garde practitioners into delightful group shows focused on the themes of labor, practices of gleaning, and the disappearing body of the Asian/American artist.&nbsp;A provocative challenge to liberal multiculturalism&#x2019;s fetish for and diminishment of ethnic and/or minority artists,&nbsp;<em>Unnamable</em> reformulates the category of Asian American art, and by doing so, revitalizes its enclosing structure.&#x201d;-Rachel C.

Swanton&#x2019;s Source Material on the History and Ethnology of the Caddo Indians is a classic reference on the Caddos. Long regarded as the dean of southeastern Native American studies, Swanton worked for decades as an ethnographer, ethnohistorian, folklorist, and linguist. In this volume he presents the history and culture of the Caddos according to the principal French, Spanish, and English sources.</p><p>In the seventeenth century, French and Spanish explorers encountered four regional alliances-Cahinnio, Cadohadacho, Hasinai, and Natchitoches-within the boundaries of the present-day states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma. Their descriptions of Caddo culture are the earliest sources available, and Swanton weaves the information from these primary documents into a narrative, translated into English, for the benefit of the modern reader. For the scholar, he includes in an appendix the extire test of three principal documents in their original Spanish.</p><p>The first half of the book is devoted to an extensive history of the Caddos, from De Soto&#x2019;s encounters in 1521 to the Caddos&#x2019; involvement in the Ghost Dance Religion of 1890. The second half discusses Caddo culture, including origin legends and religious beliefs, material culture, social relations, government, warfare, leisure, and trade. For this edition, Helen Hornbeck Tanner also provides a new foreword surveying the scholarship published on the Caddos since Swanton&#x2019;s time.</p></p><p><p><strong>John R.

In proportion as they succeed, and to the degree to which they carry this evolution, the yet unrealized potentiality which they represent will become the actual possibility of the future." <br>&#x2015;<b>Sri Aurobindo,</b> <i>The Human Cycle</i> </blockquote></blockquote> Sri Aurobindo stands out as one of the deepest and most profoundly relevant of contemporary Asian spiritual masters speaking to the West. His vision transcends the distinctive strengths and weaknesses of India and the West, and his discipline brings the yogas of the Gita to the task of world transformation. <br><br> His collaborator, The Mother, offers a blueprint for the utopian community Auroville, giving sage advice on the ideal of a spiritually based approach to education. <br><br> Robert McDermott's afterword in this revised edition recounts the increased significance of Aurobindo's message in the West&#x2015;especially for America&#x2015;since the book was first published in 1973. <br><br> Here is an invaluable resource for understanding the underlying connections and common ground between Eastern and Western teachings and traditions for modern thinkers and spiritual seekers.</p><p>Before Gandhi, Aurobindo Ghose tested the British colony with his courageous writings on independence and his extraordinary energy. A series of mystical experiences, however, turned Ghose into Sri Aurobindo, India's greatest modern writer on spiritualism. <i>The Essential Aurobindo</i> is a collection of this yogi's most important writings. Raised with a British education from the age of 5 and schooled at Cambridge, Aurobindo was thoroughly versed in Western philosophy and strove to integrate the profound ideas of East and West. His "integral yoga" has been influential among writers like Ken Wilber in the American human-potential movement, in which the spiritual side of the human being is considered the most important element of cultivation. According to Aurobindo, after the origin of life from matter, and mind from life, there must be a further, conscious evolution to a spiritual plane. Included in <i>The Essential Aurobindo</i> are writings of the Mother, Aurobindo's successor, who established an ongoing and influential collective based on the thoughts of Aurobindo. Culled from the nearly 30 volumes of Aurobindo's lifetime work, the pieces in <i>The Essential Aurobindo</i> are truly essential to an understanding of this vital and unique thinker. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><b>Robert McDermott</b>, Ph.D., is president emeritus and chair of the Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness Program at the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS).

Polar bears, seals, and killer whales. Victor Frankenstein chasing his monstrous creation across icy terrain in a dogsled. The arctic calls to mind a myriad different images. Consisting of the Arctic Ocean and parts of Canada, the United States, Russia, Greenland, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the arctic possesses a unique ecosystem&#x2014;temperatures average negative 29 degrees Fahrenheit in winter and rarely rise above freezing in summer&#x2014;and the indigenous peoples and cultures that live in the region have had to adapt to the harsh weather conditions. As global temperatures rise, the arctic is facing an environmental crisis, with melting glaciers causing grave concern around the world. But for all the renown of this frozen region, the arctic remains far from perfectly understood.&nbsp;In <i>A History of the Arctic</i>, award-winning polar historian John McCannon provides an engaging overview of the region that spans from the Stone Age to the present. McCannon discusses polar exploration and science, nation-building, diplomacy, environmental issues, and climate change, and the role indigenous populations have played in the arctic&#x2019;s story. Chronicling the history of each arctic nation, he details the many failed searches for a Northwest Passage and the territorial claims that hamper use of these waterways. He also explores the resources found in the arctic&#x2014;oil, natural gas, minerals, fresh water, and fish&#x2014;and describes the importance they hold as these resources are depleted elsewhere, as well as the challenges we face in extracting them.&nbsp;A timely assessment of current diplomatic and environmental realities, as well as the dire risks the region now faces, <i>A History of the Arctic</i> is a thoroughly engrossing book on the past&#x2014;and future&#x2014;of the top of the world.</p><p><b>John McCannon</b> is associate professor of history at Southern New Hampshire University and the author of <i>Red Arctic: Polar Exploration and the Myth of the North in the Soviet Union, 1932-1939.</i>2013 Outstanding Academic Title, Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries<br><br>"While containing an almost insatiable wealth of information, this book is incredibly fun to read...

Doel Florida State University </p> <p> "This is one of the few books in English (as well as, arguably, the best one) to deal with these themes from a widely comprehensive circumpolar perspective rather that a strictly national one. The chapter 'Crusades,' for example... examines not only those explorers familiar to English speakers, but also lesser-known Finns, Icelanders, Faroese, Greenlanders, and Russians. Indigenous people also figure large in these pages. This makes the book tremendously valuable; as an added bonus, it is approachably and engagingly written. It should serve for some considerable time as the standard work on the subject....Essential." -- Choice</p> <p> "John McCannon's book is a valuable and timely addition....It's never dull, and [McCannon] possesses a keen eye for detail, especially in chronicling the region's wildlife and the painful transition from exploration to exploitation....This is a thoughtful, provocative study that should be read by anyone who cares about the Arctic's fate." -- Geographical Magazine</p></p><h2>One Another&#x2019;s Equals: The Basis of Human Equality</h2><p><p>An enduring theme of Western philosophy is that we are all one another&#x2019;s equals. Yet the principle of basic equality is woefully under-explored in modern moral and political philosophy. In a major new work, Jeremy Waldron attempts to remedy that shortfall with a subtle and multifaceted account of the basis for the West&#x2019;s commitment to human equality.</p><p>What does it mean to say we are all one another&#x2019;s equals? Is this supposed to distinguish humans from other animals? What is human equality based on? Is it a religious idea, or a matter of human rights? Is there some essential feature that all human beings have in common? Waldron argues that there is no single characteristic that serves as the basis of equality. He says the case for moral equality rests on four capacities that all humans have the potential to possess in some degree: reason, autonomy, moral agency, and the ability to love. But how should we regard the differences that people display on these various dimensions? And what are we to say about those who suffer from profound disability&#x2015;people whose claim to humanity seems to outstrip any particular capacities they have along these lines?</p><p>Waldron, who has worked on the nature of equality for many years, confronts these questions and others fully and unflinchingly. Based on the Gifford Lectures that he delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 2015, <i>One Another&#x2019;s Equals</i> takes Waldron&#x2019;s thinking further and deeper than ever before.</p></p><p>Jeremy Waldron is University Professor in the School of Law at New York University.&#x201c;[An] important new book...[This] insightful book suggest[s] that if we don&#x2019;t recommit ourselves to political equality, we will become ever more closed, authoritarian societies. Economic elites should understand this...Without equality, the West cannot last.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Robert B. Reich</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;If basic human equality is now agreed on, perhaps it would be best just to accept it and not bother about its justification. Yet, as Jeremy Waldron makes clear in <i>One Another&#x2019;s Equals</i>, his Gifford Lectures, to have a proper debate about what kind of political arrangements equality requires we first need to fix ideas about what it amounts to.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Rosen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This highly original and important book provides a thorough and sophisticated treatment of an issue that is of fundamental importance in moral and political philosophy, but which has not received sufficient attention or defense in recent years. The book should set the standard for further discussion of these very difficult issues for years to come.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Samuel Freeman, Avalon Professor of the Humanities and Graduate Chair of Philosophy, University of Pennsylvania</b><br><br>&#x201c;Waldron writes on the topic of human equality with grace, intelligence, and passion. <i>One Another&#x2019;s Equals</i> provides an argument intelligible to general readers that also advances the philosophical discussion in ways that will warrant response from philosophers, political theorists, legal scholars, and theologians.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeffrey Stout, Princeton University</b></p><h2>The New Faces of Fascism: Populism and the Far Right</h2><p><b>What is fascism in the twenty first century?</b><br><br>What does Fascism mean at the beginning of the twenty-first century? When we pronounce this word, our memory goes back to the years between the two world wars and envisions a dark landscape of violence, dictatorships, and genocide. These images spontaneously surface in the face of the rise of radical right, racism, xenophobia, islamophobia and terrorism, the last of which is often depicted as a form of "Islamic fascism." <br><br>Beyond some superficial analogies, however, all these contemporary tendencies reveal many differences from historical fascism, probably greater than their affinities. Paradoxically, the fear of terrorism nourishes the populist and racist rights, with Marine Le Pen in France or Donald Trump in the US claiming to be the most effective ramparts against "Jihadist fascism". But since fascism was a product of imperialism, can we define as fascist a terrorist movement whose main target is Western domination? Disentangling these contradictory threads, Enzo Traverso's historical gaze helps to decipher the enigmas of the present. He suggests the concept of post-fascism--a hybrid phenomenon, neither the reproduction of old fascism nor something completely different--to define a set of heterogeneous and transitional movements, suspended between an accomplished past still haunting our memories and an unknown future.</p><p><b>Enzo Traverso</b> is the Susan and Barton Winokur Professor in the Humanities at Cornell University. His publications, all translated into various languages, include more than ten authored and edited books, including <i>The Marxists and the Jewish Question, The Jews and Germany, Understanding the Nazi Genocide, The Origins of Nazi Violence, Fire and Blood: The European Civil War, 1914-1945 </i>and <i>Left-Wing Melancholia: Marxism, History, and Memory</i>.</p><h2>Space Nuclear Radioisotope Systems (Space Nuclear Propulsion and Power)</h2><p>For operating in severe environments, long life and reliability, radioisotope power systems have proven to be the most successful of all space power sources. Two Voyager missions launched in 1977 to study Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their satellites, rings and magnetic fields and continuing to the heliosphere region are still functioning over thirty years later. Radioisotope power systems have been used on the Moon, exploring the planets, and exiting our solar system. There success is a tribute to the outstanding engineering, quality control and attention to details that went into the design and production of radioisotope power generation units. Space nuclear radioisotope systems take the form of using the thermal energy from the decay of radioisotopes and converting this energy to electric power. Reliability and safety are of prime importance. Mission success depends on the ability of being able to safely launch the systems and on having sufficient electrical power over the life of the mission. Graceful power degradation over the life of a mission is acceptable as long as it is within predictable limits. Electrical power conversion systems with inherent redundancy, such as thermoelectric conversion systems, have been favored to date. Also, radioactive decay heat has been used to maintain temperatures in spacecraft at acceptable conditions for other components. This book describes how radioisotope systems work, the requirements and safety design considerations, the various systems that have been developed, and their operational history.</p><p></p><h2>Counsels from My Heart</h2><p><i>Counsels from My Heart </i> is one of the few volumes of teachings by Dudjom Rinpoche, a legendary meditation master of the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, to become available in English.

It immediately became a bestseller, and Stephen Crane became famous. Crane set out to create "a psychological portrayal of fear." Henry Fleming, a Union Army volunteer in the Civil War, thinks "that perhaps in a battle he might run....As far as war was concerned he knew nothing of himself." And he does run in his first battle, full of fear and then remorse. He encounters a grotesquely rotting corpse propped against a tree, and a column of wounded men, one of whom is a friend who dies horribly in front of him. Fleming receives his own "red badge" when a fellow soldier hits him in the head with a gun.

His love for these authors is the touchstone of <em>Written Lives</em>. Collected here are twenty pieces recounting great writers' lives, "or, more precisely, snippets of writers' lives." Thomas Mann, Rilke, Arthur Conan Doyle, Turgenev, Djuna Barnes, Emily Bront�, Malcolm Lowry, and Kipling appear ("all fairly disastrous individuals"), and "almost nothing" in his stories is invented.<br><br> Like Isak Dinesen (who "claimed to have poor sight, yet could spot a four-leaf clover in a field from a remarkable distance away"), Mar�as has a sharp eye. Nabokov is here, making "the highly improbable assertion that he is 'as American as April in Arizona,'" as is Oscar Wilde, who, in debt on his deathbed, ordered up champagne, "remarking cheerfully, 'I am dying beyond my means.'" Faulkner, we find, when fired from his post office job, explained that he was not prepared "to be beholden to any son-of-a-bitch who had two cents to buy a stamp." Affection glows in the pages of Written Lives, evidence, as Mar�as remarks, that "although I have enjoyed writing all my books, this was the one with which I had the most fun."</p><p><p><strong>Javier Mar�as</strong> is an award-winning Spanish novelist. He is also a translator and columnist, as well as the current king of Redonda. He was born in Madrid in 1951 and published his first novel at the age of nineteen. He has held academic posts in Spain, the US (he was a visiting professor at Wellesley College) and Britain, as a lecturer in Spanish Literature at Oxford University. He has been translated into 34 languages, and more than six million copies of his books have been sold worldwide. In 1997 he won the Nelly Sachs Award; the Comunidad de Madrid award in 1998; in 2000 the Grinzane Cavour Award, the Alberto Moravia Prize, and the Dublin IMPAC Award. He also won the Spanish National Translation Award in 1979 for his translation of <em>Tristram Shandy</em> in 1979. He was a professor at Oxford University and the Complutense of Madrid. He currently lives in Madrid.</p><p><strong>MARGARET JULL COSTA</strong> is a three-time winner of the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. For New Directions, she has translated works by Rafael Chirbes, Javier Mar�as, Fernando Pessoa, E�a de Queir�s, and Enrique Vila-Matas.</p><p>It's difficult to be moderate about the charm of these brief portraits of Rimbaud, Turgenev, Rilke, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, Robert Louis Stevenson, Isak Dinesen, Djuna Barnes and a dozen other literary eminences. "The one thing that leaps out when you read about these authors," writes the acclaimed Spanish novelist Javier Mar�as, "is that they were all fairly disastrous individuals; and although they were probably no more so than anyone else whose life we know about, their example is hardly likely to lure one along the path of letters." That wry sense of amusement characterizes Mar�as's approach. Though he acknowledges the artistic greatness of his chosen writers, he prefers to point out and relish their personal oddities, all those quirks, eccentricities and obsessions that make them neurotically and sometimes pitiably human. Occasionally the stories he tells may be familiar, but Mar�as -- or rather Mar�as in Margaret Jull Costa's delicious, slyly ironic English -- brings his own light touch to their telling. Henry James, he reminds us, took against Flaubert and Rossetti because they received him in their work smocks: "On the other hand, [James's] enthusiasm for Maupassant knew no bounds, again thanks to a single visit: the French short-story writer had received him for lunch in the society of a lady who was not only naked, but wearing a mask. This struck James as the height of refinement, especially when Maupassant informed him that she was no mere courtesan, prostitute, servant, or actress, but a femme du monde, which James was perfectly happy to believe." Once Arthur Conan Doyle, who was known to get into fistfights when young and who identified with knights of old, was traveling by train through South Africa: "One of his grown-up sons commented on the ugliness of a woman who happened to walk down the corridor. He had barely had time to finish this sentence when he received a slap and saw, very close to his, the flushed face of his old father, who said very mildly: 'Just remember that no woman is ugly.'" Throughout, Mar�as tosses off the sort of facts and turns of phrase that linger in the mind: Kipling's "The Man Who Would be King" was the favorite story of both Faulkner and Proust. "The death of Yukio Mishima was so spectacular that it has almost succeeded in obliterating the many other stupid things he did in his life." Joseph Conrad's "natural state was one of disquiet bordering on anxiety." Violet Hunt, at age 13, offered herself to John Ruskin, later refused a marriage proposal from Oscar Wilde, seduced the homosexual Somerset Maugham, was seduced by H.G. Wells and lived for some years as the putative wife of Ford Madox Ford. Mar�as reminds us that William Faulkner, who once worked for the University of Mississippi post office, hated to be interrupted in his reading by "any son-of-a-bitch who had two cents to buy a stamp." He goes on: "Perhaps that is where the seeds were first sown of Faulkner's evident aversion to and scorn for letters. When he died, piles of letters, packages and manuscripts sent by admirers were found, none of which he had opened. In fact, the only letters he did open were those from publishers, and then only very cautiously: he would make a tiny slit in the envelope and then shake it to see if a cheque appeared. If it didn't, then the letter would simply join all those other things that can wait forever." In his preface, Mar�as notes that he generally writes with "affection and humour," though he confesses that he feels very little of the former for James Joyce, Thomas Mann and Yukio Mishima. The chapter on the self-important Mann is a comic masterpiece: "Any writer who leaves behind him sealed envelopes not to be opened until long after his death is clearly convinced of his own immense importance, as tends to be confirmed when, after all that patient waiting, the wretched, disappointing envelopes are finally opened. In the case of Mann and his diaries, what strikes one most is that he obviously felt that absolutely everything that happened to him was worthy of being recorded.... [The diaries] give the impression that Mann was thinking ahead to a studious future which would exclaim after each entry: 'Good heavens, so that was the day when the Great Man wrote such and such a page of The Holy Sinner and then, the following night, read some verses by Heine, that is so revealing!'" Most of these pages, adds Mar�as, chronicle the state of Mann's stomach and bowels or include plaintive entries like: "Sexual disturbance and disturbance in my activities when faced by the impossibility of refusing to write an obituary for Eduard Keyserling." Other entries make clear the married Mann's attraction to muscular youths, such as "a healthy young fellow with golden hair" or a young gardener, "beardless, with brown arms and open shirt," who gave the writer "quite a turn." According to Mar�as -- and it's hard to argue with him -- Malcolm Lowry, author of Under the Volcano, seems "to have been the most calamitous writer in the whole history of literature." An alcoholic, he was known to drink shaving lotion and his own urine. Shortly after their marriage, his first wife started going off with other men, once climbing onto a bus in Mexico "to spend a jolly week with some engineers." He tried to strangle his second wife. Twice. And he had lots of trouble with animals, once punching a horse in the ear so that it fell to its knees: "Even sadder was what happened to a poor little rabbit that he was absentmindedly stroking on his lap while talking one night to the pet's owner and the owner's mother: the rabbit suddenly went stiff; Lowry had broken its neck with his small, clumsy hands. For two days, he wandered the streets of London carrying the corpse, not knowing what to do with it and consumed by self-loathing." Isak Dinesen, we're reminded, married Bror Blixen, who promptly infected her with syphilis, though she took a long time before divorcing him. Here the urbane author of All Souls and Your Face Tomorrow injects one of those observations about life that seem so insightfully European: Dinesen's "husband was the twin brother of the man she had loved from girlhood, and bonds formed through a third party are perhaps the most difficult to break." He continues: "Having syphilis obliged her, early on, to renounce sex, and seeing that there was no help to be had from God and bearing in mind how terrible it was for a young woman to be denied 'the right to love,' Isak Dinesen promised her soul to the Devil, and he promised her, in return, that everything she experienced thenceforth would become a story. That, at least, is what she told a non-lover." Though he envies the cheerful humanity of Laurence Sterne, the character that Mar�as most obviously adores is the caustic, illusionless Madame du Deffand, best known today as one of the world's great letter writers, her correspondents including Voltaire and, above all, Horace Walpole. "In both youth and maturity," writes Mar�as, she "had known no weak passions, only overwhelming ones." He tantalizes with accounts of her early life: "During her youth, having already been married and almost immediately separated ('Feeling no love at all for one's husband is a fairly widespread misfortune'), she had taken part in a number of orgies, to which she had doubtless been introduced by her first lover, the regent Philippe d'Orl�ans." Madame du Deffand's wit is still celebrated in France. When a priest marveled at the miracle of St. Denis, who had managed to walk after his beheading all the way from Montmartre to the church that now bears his name, she answered: "The distance does not matter, it is only the first step that is difficult." She once forthrightly announced, "I find everyone loathsome." She could also be optimistic and trusting, in her fashion: "One is surrounded by weapons and by enemies, and the people we call our friends are merely the ones we know would not themselves murder us, but would merely let the murderers have their way." As I say, this is a delightful volume. Mar�as closes it with a longish piece about his collection of portrait postcards of writers, meditating on what the various images mean to him: The young Gide, he concludes, looks like "a professional duellist"; T.S. Eliot like "a man who has spent decades combing his hair in exactly the same way." But let me finish with Mar�as's reflections on a photograph of Rilke: "Rilke does not have the face one would suppose him to have, so delicate and unbearable was he in his habits and needs as a great poet.... His face is frankly dangerous, with those dark circles under deep-set eyes, and the sparse, drooping moustache which gives him a strangely Mongolian appearance; those cold, oblique eyes make him look almost cruel, and only his hands -- clasped as they should be, unlike Conrad's indecisive hands -- and the quality of his clothes -- an excellent tie and excellent cloth -- give him some semblance of repose or somewhat mitigate that cruelty. The truth is that he could be a visionary doctor in his laboratory, awaiting the results of some monstrous and forbidden experiment." One glance at Rilke's picture and you'll see that Mar�as's description is exactly right. Michael Dirda is a book critic for Book World.

Along the way, he illuminates the powerful role of photographs, films, illustrated magazines, and image-filled history books in the construction of national identity, showing how Mexicans have both made themselves and been made with the webs of significance spun by modern media. Central to Mraz&#x2019;s book is photography, which was distributed widely throughout Mexico in the form of <i>cartes-de-visite</i>, postcards, and illustrated magazines. Mraz analyzes the work of a broad range of photographers, including Guillermo Kahlo, Winfield Scott, Hugo Brehme, Agust�n V�ctor Casasola, Tina Modotti, Manuel �lvarez Bravo, H�ctor Garc�a, Pedro Meyer, and the New Photojournalists. He also examines representations of Mexico&#x2019;s past in the country&#x2019;s influential picture histories: popular, large-format, multivolume series replete with thousands of photographs and an assortment of texts.<p></p><p>Turning to film, Mraz compares portrayals of the Mexican Revolution by Fernando de Fuentes to the later movies of Emilio Fern�ndez and Gabriel Figueroa.

Mraz also analyzes the leading comedians of the Mexican screen, representations of the 1968 student revolt, and depictions of Frida Kahlo in films made by Paul Leduc and Julie Taymor.

It lay like a gauntlet thrown down; to sail around the world alone and non-stop. No one had ever done it, no one knew if it could be done. In 1968, nine men - six Englishmen, two Frenchmen and an Italian - set out to try, a race born of coincidence of their timing. One didn&#39;t even know how to sail. They had more in common with Captain Cook or Ferdinand Magellan than with the high-tech, extreme sailors of today, a mere forty years later. It was not the sea or the weather that determined the nature of their voyages but the men they were, and they were as different from one another as Scott from Amundsen. Only one of the nine crossed the finishing line after ten months at sea. The rest encountered despair, sublimity, madness and even death.</p><p>Peter Nichols is the author of the bestselling novel The Rocks, and the international bestsellers A Voyage for Madmen (finalist for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year), Evolution&#39;s Captain, and three other books of fiction, memoir, and non-fiction. His novel Lodestar was nominated for the Dublin IMPAC literary award. He has taught creative writing at a number of universities, including Georgetown University, Bowdoin College, New York University in Paris, and Antioch University Los Angeles. Before turning to writing full time, he held a 100 ton USCG Ocean Operator&#39;s licence and was a professional yacht delivery skipper for 10 years. He has also worked in advertising in London, as a screenwriter in Los Angeles, been a shepherd in Wales, and sailed alone in a small boat across the Atlantic.In the psychedelic summer of 1968, as Apollo 8 soared toward the moon and the Democratic Convention crashed in Chicago, nine men tried finally to accomplish the sailor's age-old ultimate goal: a solo, nonstop circumnavigation of the world. Nichols (Sea Change) deftly introduces myriad aspects of a voyage that promised "dubious, unquantifiable" rewards. He insightfully contextualizes the endeavor as an offshoot of Sir Francis Chichester's famous 1967 solo circumnavigation (with one stop), which represented to England a "longed-for" heroism. Detailing the British media's successful exploitation of the so-called race, he approaches the voyage as the remarkable result of nine men wishing to outdo Chichester. Nichols painstakingly describes the enormous difficulty of solo navigation in the pre-global positioning system of the 1960s. These "hardcase egomaniacs driven by complex desires and vainglory to attempt an extreme, life-threatening endeavor" used only rudimentary equipment and their wits. Nichols is at his liveliest when describing the only two participants who "were really happy aboard their boats": the French-Asian Bernard Moitessier, the most skilled sailor, whose mystical seamanship brings surprises, and the British Robin Knox-Johnson, who was energized during his journey by the memory of "the Elizabethan sea heroes of his youth." Nichols also delivers a compelling portrait of English Donald Crowhurst, an electronics engineer whose "supercharged personality" wreaked havoc on the entire race. While Nichols's pace is neither breakneck nor suspenseful, his careful details and psychological insight make for a riveting account of the triumphant human spirit. 16-page photo insert, 8 maps. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Moral Darwinism: How We Became Hedonists</h2><p>Abortion. Euthanasia. Infanticide. Sexual promiscuity. Ideas and actions once unthinkable have become commonplace. We seem to live in a different moral universe than we occupied just a few decades ago. Consent and noncoercion seem to be the last vestiges of a morality long left behind. Christian moral tenets are now easily dismissed and have been replaced with what is curiously presented as a superior, more magnanimous, respectful and even humble morality. How did we end up so far away from where we began? Can the decline be stopped? Ben Wiker, in this provocative and insightful book, traces the amazing story that explains our present cultural situation. Wiker finds the roots of our moral slide reaching all the way back to the ethical theory and atheistic cosmology of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. Christian teaching had been in contention with this worldview long before it reached its pinnacle with the rise and acceptance of Darwinism. But it was Darwinism, Wiker contends, that provided this ancient teaching with the seemingly modern and scientific basis that captured twentieth-century minds. Wiker demonstrates that this ancient atomistic and materialistic philosophy supplies the guiding force behind Darwinism and powerfully propels the hedonistic bent of our society while promoting itself under the guise of pure science. This book is a challenge not only to those who believe Darwinism to be purely scientific fact but to Christian who have at times inconsistently lived out their Christian moral convictions and so have failed to recognize and address the ancient corrosive underpinnings of our present moral and intellectual crisis.</p><p>Benjamin Wiker (Ph.D., Vanderbilt), is a full-time writer and senior fellow of Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington. His work has appeared in such publications as <em>First Things, National Catholic Register, Crisis, Catholic World Report</em> and the <em>New Oxford Review.</em> Books he has written include <em>Moral Darwinism</em> and <em>Architects of the Culture of Death.</em>"Several authors have attempted to get at the roots of the current culture war. James Davison Hunter has traced its sociological roots. Robert Bork has traced its political roots. Phillip Johnson has traced its Darwinian roots. But none of them has traced the historical roots of the culture war back to its metaphysical foundation. Ben Wiker does that brilliantly in the present book. . . . If you really want to understand why our culture is in its current state, you must read this book." (William A. Dembski, author of Intelligent Design (from the foreword))<br><br>"It was once taken as a matter of course that ideas once argued and reargued in Greek philosophy kept recurring in different ways in subsequent philosophical systems and eras. Classical materialism was not as unrelated to modern materialism as one might suspect. Marx studied Epicurus. Benjamin Wiker here traces this history of scientific and moral materialism. What is unique about his book is that he sees this materialism in scientists who often did not see what their own terms implied. As Chesterton said, 'We must either not argue with a man at all, or argue with him on his terms.' This is what Wiker does with the not totally surprising result that science more and more tends itself to suggest that its own materialism is not as well founded as at first sight seemed to be the case. Even Christians are surprised by this turn of events or better facts. Intrinsic designs and a cosmos appearing suddenly from evidently nothing keep the materialist philosophers wondering. Wiker's subtitle, <em>How We All Became Hedonists</em>, hints at something Aristotle already knew?that hedonism explains neither itself nor the evolution of the world and what it means to understand it." (James V. Schall, S. J., Georgetown University, (Washington, D.C.))<br><br>"The core components of a worldview hang together in intricate and important ways. More particularly, the ethical vision of a worldview is usually grounded in the worldview?s depiction of reality, especially of human persons and of how we got here. This is one reason why, given the current moral crisis, it is ill advised to attempt to combine a materialist anthropology and a Darwinist creation myth with a Christian worldview. Benjamin Wiker?s timely book does a masterful job of providing a readable historical sketch of the interrelationships among these ideas and thereby provides a warning to those Christians who seek a facile compromise with a materialist view of human persons and a Darwinist understanding of origins." (J. P. Moreland, professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, and author (with Scot Rae) of Body and Soul (IVP))<br><br>"Ben Wiker's book is profound, practical and provocative. It reveals some of the most important and disturbing--yet neglected--truths about the ancient philosophical roots of what is usually presented as 'modern science.' Wiker shows how much of Darwinism is not only anti-religious but unscientific. This is a very important book." (Scott Hahn, Franciscan University of Steubenville (Steubenville, Ohio))<br><br>"Darwinian evolution pretends to be modern empirical science, but it is merely the latest manifestation of an ancient materialistic philosophy. In this fascinating book, Benjamin Wiker exposes the true nature of Darwinism and its profoundly poisonous consequences for morality. If you thought that the present controversy over evolution and intelligent design was a localized dispute about science education, think again. At stake is nothing less than the future of our civilization." (Jonathan Wells, author of Icons of Evolution)<br><br>"In this excellent book, Ben Wiker shows decisively that America's moral decline is a product of the Darwinian worldview which, in turn, is a revival of ancient materialist philosophy. The book traces key aspects of today's "culture war" back to the dawn of Western thought, giving a clear-sighted guide to how history shapes the present battle." (Nancy Pearcey, coauthor of How Now Shall We Live? and The Soul of Science)<br><br>"Benjamin Wiker masterfully traces the ancient roots of the conflict between belief in the intelligent design of the universe and atheistic materialism. This wonderfully written book is a must-read for understanding our modern culture wars." (Michael J. Behe, professor of biochemisty, LeHigh University)<br><br>"I have written several books about the foundations of evolution, but I learned much from this superb volume, particularly about the enduring importance of Epicurus and his philosophy." (Phillip E. Johnson, author of Darwin on Trial and Reason in the Balance)</p><h2>Neither Black Nor White: Slavery and Race Relations in Brazil and the United States</h2><p><p>Carl Degler&#x2019;s 1971 Pulitzer-Prize-winning study of comparative slavery in Brazil and the United States is reissued in the Wisconsin paperback edition, making it accessible for all students of American and Latin American history and sociology.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Until Degler&#x2019;s groundbreaking work, scholars were puzzled by the differing courses of slavery and race relations in the two countries. Brazil never developed a system of rigid segregation, such as appeared in the United States, and blacks in Brazil were able to gain economically and retain far more of their African culture. Rejecting the theory of Giberto Freyre and Frank Tannenbaum&#x2014;that Brazilian slavery was more humane&#x2014;Degler instead points to a combination of demographic, economic, and cultural factors as the real reason for the differences.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In the early 1970s when studies in social history were beginning to blossom on the North American scene, Carl Degler&#x2019;s prize-winning contribution was a thoughtful provocative essay in comparative history. Its thoughtfulness has not diminished with the years. Indeed, it is as topical today as when it was first published. The Brazilian experience with rapid industrialization and its attempt to restore democratic government indicates that the issues which Degler treated in the early 1970s are more pertinent than ever today.&#x201d;&#x2014;Franklin W.

This book provides an in-depth and penetrating look at religious violence and the attitudes that drove it in the Christian Roman Empire of the fourth and fifth centuries, a unique period shaped by the marriage of Christian ideology and Roman imperial power. Drawing together materials spanning a wide chronological and geographical range, Gaddis asks what religious conflict meant to those involved, both perpetrators and victims, and how violence was experienced, represented, justified, or contested. His innovative analysis reveals how various groups employed the language of religious violence to construct their own identities, to undermine the legitimacy of their rivals, and to advance themselves in the competitive and high-stakes process of Christianizing the Roman Empire.<br><br>Gaddis pursues case studies and themes including martyrdom and persecution, the Donatist controversy and other sectarian conflicts, zealous monks' assaults on pagan temples, the tyrannical behavior of powerful bishops, and the intrigues of church councils. In addition to illuminating a core issue of late antiquity, this book also sheds light on thematic and comparative dimensions of religious violence in other times, including our own.<br><br></p><p>"This is an extremely interesting, stimulating and very useful book. Gaddis has succeeded in drawing together a wide geographic and chronological range of materials to give a nuanced and comprehensive picture.

Now 27, she is the unmarried mother of three and is raising her kids in one of Philadelphia's poorest neighborhoods.

Why do so many poor American youth like Millie continue to have children before they can afford to take care of them?<br><br>Over a span of five years, sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas talked in-depth with 162 low-income single moms like Millie to learn how they think about marriage and family. <i>Promises I Can Keep </i>offers an intimate look at what marriage and motherhood mean to these women and provides the most extensive on-the-ground study to date of why they put children before marriage despite the daunting challenges they know lie ahead.</p><p>"This is the most important study ever written on motherhood and marriage among low-income urban women.

In an epoch representing a critical juncture for the future well-being of the planet based on our relationship to nature, the text has been updated to reflect the growth in significance of the interaction between tourism and the natural environment as a part of this discourse. It communicates a range of key conceptual debates on the ethics and economics of the consuming nature for tourism and relates these to real world examples whilst evaluating environmental planning, and management responses. The book seeks to highlight the relevance of the significance of tourism for nature within the framework of society, as a system of inter-connected places across space and time, exploring the relationship of the environments of where tourists come from with the ones that they travel to. </p> <p></p> <p>The updated features include:</p> <ul> <p> </p><li>new chapters on philosophies and constructs of the environment, environmental ethics, and tourist consumption </li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>an extensive range of international case studies used to illustrate the theoretical ideas presented</li> <p></p> <p> </p><li>boxes offering bite sized insights, and think points designed to encourage students to further engage with the topics discussed</li> <p></p></ul><i> </i><p><i>Environment and Tourism</i> emphasises a holistic view of the tourism system and how it interacts with nature, illustrating the positive and negative effects of this relationship. It emphasises how ontologies of the environment influence the planning and management of tourism for natural resource conservation and human development. It is an invaluable tool for anyone studying Human Geography, Tourism and Environmental Studies, as well as for policy makers and consultants working in the field of tourism development.</p></p><p><p><strong>Andrew Holden </strong>is Professor of Environment and Tourism in the Institute for Tourism Research (INTOUR) at the University of Bedfordshire, UK.</p><p>'As the discourse on global climate change gains momentum, it is refreshing to see a book that captures the complexities and limitations of current environmental knowledge.

Ram�n del Valle-Incl�n, one of the masters of Spanish modernism, combines the splintered points of view of a cubist painting with the campy excesses of 19th-century serial fiction to paint an astonishing picture of a ruthless tyrant facing armed revolt.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the Day of the Dead, and revolution has broken out, creating mayhem from Baby Roach&#x2019;s Cathouse to the Harris Circus to the deep jungle of Tico Maip�. Tyrant Banderas steps forth, assuring all that he is in favor of freedom of assembly and democratic opposition. Mean�while, his secret police lock up, torture, and execute students and Indian peasants in a sinister castle by the sea where even the sharks have tired of a diet of revolutionary flesh. Then the opposition strikes back. They besiege the dictator&#x2019;s citadel, hoping to bring justice to a downtrodden, starving populace.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Bush&#x2019;s new translation of Valle-Incl�n&#x2019;s seminal novel, the first into English since 1929, reveals a writer whose tragic sense of humor is as memorably grotesque and disturbing as Goya&#x2019;s in his <i>The Disasters of War</i>.</p><p>Ram�n del Valle-Incl�n (1866&#x2013;1936) was born into an impoverished aristocratic family in a rural village in Galicia, Spain. Obedient to his father&#x2019;s wishes, he studied law in Compostela, but<br>after his father&#x2019;s death in 1889 he moved to Madrid to work as a journalist and critic. In 1892 Valle-Incl�n traveled to Mexico, where he remained for more than a year. His first book of stories came out in Spain in 1895. A well-known figure in the caf�s of Madrid, famous for his spindly frame, cutting wit, long hair, longer beard, black cape, and single arm (the other having been lost after a fight with a critic), Valle-Incl�n was celebrated as the author of <i>Sonatas: The Memoirs of the Marquis of Bradom�n</i>, which was published in 1904 and is considered the finest novel of Spanish <i>modernismo</i>, as well as for his extensive and important career in the theater, not only as a major twentieth-century playwright but also as a director and actor. He reported from the western front during World War I, and after the war he developed an unsettling new style that he dubbed <i>esperpento</i>&#x2014;a Spanish word that means both a grotesque, frightening person and a piece of nonsense&#x2014;and described as a search for &#x201c;the comic side of the tragedy of life.&#x201d; Partly inspired by his second visit to Mexico in 1920, when the country was in the throes of revolution, <i>Tyrant Banderas</i> is Valle-Incl�n&#x2019;s greatest novel and the essence of <i>esperpento</i>.<br><br>Peter Bush is an award-winning translator who lives in Barcelona. Among his recent translations are Juan Goytisolo&#x2019;s <i>N�jar Country</i> and Teresa Solana&#x2019;s <i>A Shortcut to Paradise</i>. He is currently translating Quim Monz�&#x2019;s <i>A Thousand Morons</i> and Josep Pla&#x2019;s <i>The Gray Notebook</i> (forthcoming from NYRB Classics).<br><br>Alberto Manguel is an Argentinian-born Canadian essayist and novelist. He has written twenty works of criticism, including <i>The Dictionary of Imaginary Places</i> (with Gianni Guadalupi), <i>A History of Reading</i>, and <i>The Library at Night</i>; edited more than twenty literary anthologies; and is the author of five novels, including <i>News from a Foreign Country Came</i>, which won the McKitterick Prize in 1992. An Officier de l&#x2019;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (France), he has also been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.&#x201c;Valle-Incl�n had the sensitivity to capture the essential quality of life in my unhappy, comic, and beautiful country, and his <i>Tyrant Banderas</i> remains one of the most moving books about Mexico.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Diego Rivera<br><br>&#x201c;An erotic, anarchic and Galician poet of the grotesque.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Billington, <i>Guardian</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Because dictators have been a staple of Latin history, they&#x2019;re a staple of the Latin novel. Spaniard Ramon del Valle-Incl�n broke ground in 1926 with <i>Tirano Banderas</i>.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Miami Herald</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;The radical innovation in the theater that came after World War I is known here mainly through the plays of Brecht. In Spain, the prophet of this new movement was Ram�n del Valle-Incl�n. . . Written in 1920, <i>Divinas Palabras</i> actually precedes Brecht&#x2019;s agitprop dramas.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;It is a dark, violent, gorey work whose unbridled lyricism cannot mask its many horrors. . . . <i>Tirano Banderas</i>, which Valle-Incl�n wrote in his 20s, is Cubist in that its writing is highly fragmented, while its range of deep, intense colours is reminiscent of Goya. But its main characteristic is <i>esperpento</i>, a genre created by Ville-Incl�n himself. <i>Esperpento</i> is a mixture of terror and comedy, in which a character from tragedy is reduced to the dimensions of a fairground huckster. <i>Tirano Banderas </i>is a farce written with a poisoned pen.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Manchester Guardian Weekly</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Tirano Banderas</i> was the first novel to describe a South American dictator.

Rightly or wrongly, being perfect has become an ethical ideal to live by, and according to which we judge ourselves good or bad, a success or a failure. <i>Perfect Me</i> explores the changing nature of the beauty ideal, showing how it is more dominant, more demanding, and more global than ever before.</p><p>Heather Widdows argues that our perception of the self is changing. More and more, we locate the self in the body--not just our actual, flawed bodies but our transforming and imagined ones. As this happens, we further embrace the beauty ideal. Nobody is firm enough, thin enough, smooth enough, or buff enough&#x2015;not without significant effort and cosmetic intervention. And as more demanding practices become the norm, more will be required of us, and the beauty ideal will be harder and harder to resist.</p><p>If you have ever felt the urge to "make the best of yourself" or worried that you were "letting yourself go," this book explains why. <i>Perfect Me</i> examines how the beauty ideal has come to define how we see ourselves and others and how we structure our daily practices&#x2015;and how it enthralls us with promises of the good life that are dubious at best. <i>Perfect Me</i> demonstrates that we must first recognize the ethical nature of the beauty ideal if we are ever to address its harms.</p></p><p><p>"Widdows brings much-needed subtlety to current conversations about the moral and social role of physical appearance in our daily lives."<b>--A. W. Eaton, editor of <i>Talk to Her</i></b></p><p>"This groundbreaking book is an extended reflection on what Widdows argues to be the increasingly demanding norms of feminine beauty. <i>Perfect Me</i> moves forward from both second wave feminist critiques of the &#x2018;fashion-beauty complex&#x2019; and third wave feminist insistence on individual empowerment and choice. Widdows acknowledges the pleasures of the beauty ideal but argues that it produces significant communal harms. She proposes reframing these harms as public health concerns, a shift that opens the way for new and more systemic ethical analyses."<b>--Alison M. Jaggar, University of Colorado at Boulder</b></p><p> "Innovative and original."<b>--Anne Phillips, author of <i>The Politics of the Human</i></b></p><p> "Widdows brings much-needed subtly to current conversations about the moral and social role of physical appearance in our daily lives."<b>--A.

In this undramatic fashion, the international community closed the book on the drama of divided Germany. But nothing so momentous could be quite so quiet and uncomplicated, as this volume makes strikingly clear. This is the first book to go behind the scenes through access to still not opened archives in many countries. <i>Germany Unified and Europe Transformed</i> discloses the moves and maneuvers that ended the Cold War division of Europe.</p><p>Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice, who served in the White House during these years, have combed a vast number of documents and other sources in German and Russian as well as English. They also interviewed the major actors in the drama--George Bush, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Eduard Shevardnadze, James Baker, Anatoly Chernyayev, Brent Scowcroft, Horst Teltschik, and many others. Their firsthand accounts merge to create a complete, detailed, and powerfully immediate picture of what happened. The book takes us into Gorbachev's world, illuminating why the Soviet leader set such cataclysmic forces in motion in the late 1980s and how these forces outstripped his plans. We follow the tense debates between Soviet and East German officials over whether to crush the first wave of German protesters--and learn that the opening of the Berlin Wall was in fact one of the greatest bureaucratic blunders in human history. The narrative then reveals the battle for the future of East Germany as it took shape between West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the reform Communist leader, Hans Modrow--East Germany's "little Gorbachev." Zelikow and Rice show how Kohl and George Bush held off the reactions of governments throughout Europe so that Kohl could awaken East Germans to the possibility of reunification on his terms. Then the battle over the future of the NATO alliance began in earnest.</p><p>The drama that would change the face of Europe took place largely backstage, and this book lets us in on the strategies and negotiations, the nerve-racking risks, last-minute decisions, and deep deliberations that brought it off. It is the most authoritative depiction of contemporary statecraft to appear in decades.</p></p><p>The ending of the Cold War division of Europe took place largely backstage, and this book lets us in on the strategies and negotiations, the nerve-racking risks, last-minute decisions, and deep deliberations that brought if off.

Practical employment of new media often ignores their rich contexts, which contain examples of the distinct logics and different affordances of those media, wasting the very characteristics that make them most effective and potentially revolutionary for pedagogy. _On Multimodality: New Media in Composition Studies_ urges composition scholars and teachers to become aware of the rich histories and rhetorical capabilities of new media so that students' work with those media is enlivened and made substantive.</p><p>Jonathan Alexander is professor of English, campus writing coordinator, and director of the Center for Excellence in Writing and Communication at the University of California, Irvine. Jacqueline Rhodes is professor of English at California State University, San Bernardino, where her scholarly work focuses on intersections of rhetoric, materiality, and technology.This project is critically important at this moment in our field. Multimodality has yet to be deeply theorized within composition studies, and I see _On Multimodality: New Media in Composition Studies_ as making a move to complicate and enrich our discussions. --Kristin Arola, Washington State University<br><br>With this book, Alexander and Rhodes continue to examine the galaxy surrounding one of the most critical questions of the field: what is "composing"? Their assertion--that we must reconsider what is composed, with what technologies, for what purposes and what audiences--turns some of our most taken-for-granted assumptions about writing and teaching writing inside out in provocative and compelling ways. --Linda Adler-Kassner, University of California, Santa Barbara</p><h2>Talking Power: The Politics Of Language</h2><p>Why is unintelligibility so valued in academia? How can a joke that&#39;s funny in one culture be an insult in another? In this book, a linguist answers these and other questions, revealing the ways in which what we say and how we say it help us to accomplish our aims.</p><p>From courtroom to classroom, from summit talk to small talk, how what we say and how we say it influences every aspect of our lives.</p><h2>Explicit and Authentic Acts: Amending the U.S. Constitution, 1776-1995</h2><p>In his farewell address, President Washington reminded his audience that the Constitution, "till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all." He regarded the Constitution as a binding document worthy of devout allegiance, but also believed that it contains a clear and appropriate procedure for its own reform. David Kyvig's illuminating study provides the most complete and insightful history of that amendment process and its fundamental importance for American political life.<br>Over the course of the past two centuries, more than 10,000 amendments have been proposed by the method stipulated in Article V of the Constitution. Amazingly, only 33 have garnered the required two-thirds approval from both houses of Congress, and only 27 were ultimately ratified into law by the states. Despite their small number, those amendments have revolutionized American government while simultaneously legitimizing and preserving its continued existence. Indeed, they have dramatically altered the relationship between state and federal authority, as well as between government and private citizens.<br>Kyvig reexamines the creation and operation of Article V, illuminating the process and substance of each major successful and failed effort to change the formal structure, duties, and limits of the federal government. He analyzes in detail the Founders' intentions; the periods of great amendment activity during the 1790s, 1860s, 1910s, and 1960s; and the considerable consequences of amendment failure involving slavery, alcohol prohibition, child labor, New Deal programs, school prayer, equal rights for women, abortion, balanced budgets, term limits, and flag desecration.<br>Ultimately, Kyvig demonstrates that so-called "constitutional revolutions" can only endure through formal amendment; without it such sea changes as the New Deal are likely to be temporary amidst the shifting winds of political fortune. That truth underscores the centrality of the amendment process to American constitutionalism, sheds light on the "amendment fever" that swept through the 104th Congress, and better prepares us to deal with such initiatives in the future.</p><p>Winner of the Bancroft Prize, the Henry Adams Prize, and the Ohio Academy of History Prize <p>"Lucidly written and magisterial in scope, this book will be the standard work for many years to come.

Lee's fifth child, began her journal in December 1852 at the early age of twelve. An articulate young woman, her stated ambitions were modest: "The everyday life of a little school girl of twelve years is not startling," she observed in April 1853; but in fact, her five-year record of a southern girl's life is lively, unpredictable, and full of interesting detail.<br><br>The journal opens with a description of the Lee family life in their beloved home, Arlington. Like many military families, the Lees moved often, but Agnes and her family always thought of Arlington -- "with its commanding view, fine old trees, and the soft wild luxuriance of its woods" -- as home. When Lee was appointed the superintendent of West Point, the family reluctantly moved with him to the military academy, but wherever she happened to be, Agnes engagingly described weddings, lavish dinners, concerts, and fancy dress balls.<br><br>No mere social butterfly, she also recounted hours teaching slaves (an illegal act at that time) and struggling with her conscience. Often she questioned her own spiritual worthiness; in fact, Agnes expressed herself most openly and ardently when examining her religious commitment and reflecting on death. As pious as whe was eager to improve herself, Agnes prayed that "He would satisfy that longing within me to <i>do</i> something to <i>be</i> something."<br><br>In 1855 General Lee went to Texas, while his young daughter was enrolled in the elite Virginia Female Institute in Staunton. Agnes' letters to her parents complete the picture that she has given us of herself -- an appealingly conscientious young girl who had a sense of humor, who strove to live up to her parents' expectations, and who returned fully the love so abundantly given to her.<br><br>Agnes' last journal entry was made in January 1858, only three years before the Civil War began. In 1873 she died at Lexington at the young age of thirty-two.<br><br>The volume continues with recollections by Mildred Lee, the youngest of the Lee children, about her sister Agnes' death and the garden at Arlington. "I wish I could paint that dear old garden!" she writes. "I have seen others, adorned and beautified by Kings and princes, but none ever seemed so fair to me, as the Kingdom of my childhood."<br><br><i>Growing Up in the 1850s</i> includes an introduction by Robert Edward Lee deButts, Jr., great-great-grandson of General Lee, and a historical note about Arlington House by Mary Tyler Freeman Cheek, Director for Virginia of the Robert E. Lee Memorial Association. The editor, Mary Custis Lee deButts, is Agnes Lee's niece.<br><br></p><p>Eleanor Agnes Lee, Robert E.

Examining the history of drifting, he situates contemporary drift within today&#x2019;s economic, legal, and cultural dynamics. He also highlights a distinctly North American form of drift&#x2014;that of the train-hopping hobo&#x2014;by tracing the hobo&#x2019;s legal and political history and by detailing his own immersion in the world of contemporary train-hoppers. Along the way, Ferrell sheds light on the ephemeral intensity of drifting communities and explores the contested politics of drift: the strategies that legal authorities employ to control drifters in the interest of economic development, the social and spatial dislocations that these strategies ironically exacerbate, and the ways in which drifters create their own slippery forms of resistance. Ferrell concludes that drift constitutes a necessary subject of social inquiry and a way of revitalizing social inquiry itself, offering as it does new models for knowing and engaging with the contemporary world.</p><p>&#x201c;Jeff Ferrell guides us through a way of thinking about drift that provides an impetus to an imaginative and emancipatory politics. This is a work that transforms despair into hope, dependency into autonomy, and separation into unity. As a catalyst for imagination,&nbsp;<i>Drift</i>&nbsp;is nothing short of brilliant.&#x201d;&#x2014;Simon Springer, author of&nbsp;<i>The Anarchist Roots of Geography: Toward Spatial Emancipation</i>&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Beautifully written and sensitively researched, Ferrell&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Drift</i>&nbsp;represents the first socio-criminological attempt to capture the growing sense of emotional and existential precarity now confronting many young people as they attempt to negotiate the complex life worlds of late modernity.&nbsp;Another tour de force by&nbsp;one of criminology&#x2019;s most engaging and enlightening scholars.&#x201d;&#x2014;Keith Hayward, Professor of Criminology, Faculty of Law, University of Copenhagen, Denmark<br><br> &#x201c;Beautifully interweaving sociology, biography, and criminology, <i>Drift</i> is Ferrell&#x2019;s most visionary work to date, tracing the entanglement of motion with every trajectory of post-Fordist life at the horizons of modernity. An inquiry, meditation, analysis, and performance, all through the register of poetics, <i>Drift </i>is a volume in the shape of our times.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michelle Brown,&nbsp;Associate Professor of Sociology,&nbsp;University of Tennessee<br><br> &#x201c;Making connections across decades, continents, and&nbsp;cultures, this compelling&nbsp;and evocative&nbsp;book attends to migration and movement,&nbsp;as social &#x2018;problem&#x2019; and as revolutionary potential. Ferrell finds the commonalities&nbsp;between hobos, gutter punks, dumpster divers, and migrant workers, and argues for a way of thinking that embraces chance and expands the trajectories of criminological knowledge.&#x201d;&#x2014;Alison Young, Francine V. McNiff Professor of Criminology, University of Melbourne<br> &#x201c;Theoretically rich and beautifully evocative,&nbsp;<i>Drift</i>&nbsp;is a masterful analysis of contemporary dislocations. Ferrell deftly weaves strands of history, political economy, geography, sociology, and cultural studies to offer a deeply contemplative assessment of late modernity through the lens of drift.

Even in his mediations on theology Milton strove to demonstrate that liberty&#x2014;of conscience&#x2014;is one of the inviolable rights of free peoples. In his theological writings he seeks to unite ancient philosophy and the authority of the Judeo-Christian scriptures to support the concept of free, republican government. During the crises that wracked English life and liberties during the seventeenth century, Milton's was one of the indispensable voices and pens. He published several revolutionary manifestos, two works defending regicide, and of course the famous <b><i>Areopagitica,</i></b> or defense of freedom of expression and the press against censorship.

In the 1960s, movements as diverse as Latin American neo-concretism, op art and &#x201c;eccentric abstraction&#x201d; disrupted the homogeneity, universality, and rationality associated with abstraction. These modes of abstraction opened up new forms of engagement with the phenomenal world as well as the possibility of diverse readings of the same forms, ranging from formalist and transcendental to socio-economic and conceptual. </p><p>In the 1980s, the writings of Peter Halley, Fredric Jameson, and others considered an increasingly abstracted world in terms of its economic, social, and political conditions&#x2015;all of which were increasingly manifested through abstract codes or sites of style. Such economic abstraction is primarily addressed in art through subject or theme, but Deleuze and Guattari's notion of art as abstract machine opens up possibilities for art's role in the construction of a new kind of social reality. In more recent art, a third strand of abstraction emerges: a form of social abstraction centered on the strategy of withdrawal. Social abstraction implies stepping aside, a movement away from the mainstream, suggesting the possibilities for art to maneuver within self-organized, withdrawn initiatives in the field of cultural production. </p><p>Artists surveyed include: <br>Lee Bontecou, Louise Bourgeois, Amilcar de Castro, Paul C�zanne, Lygia Clark, Kajsa Dahlberg, Stephan Dillemuth, Marcel Duchamp, Gardar Eide Einarsson, G�nther F�rg, Liam Gillick, Ferreira Gullar, Jean H�lion, Eva Hesse, Jakob Jakobsen, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd, Wassily Kandinsky, Sol LeWitt, Piet Mondrian, Bruce Nauman, H�lio Oiticica, Blinky Palermo, Lygia Pape, Mai-Thu Perret, Jackson Pollock, Tobias Rehberger, Bridget Riley, Emily Roysden, Lucas Samaras, Julian Stanczak, Frank Stella, Hito Steyerl, Theo van Doesburg</p><p>Writers include:<br>Alfred H.

Dancer Steve Paxton in the 1970s considered this distance a territory for investigation. His study of intentional contact resulted in a public performance in 1972 in a Soho gallery, and the name "contact improvisation" was coined for the form of unrehearsed dance he introduced. Rather than copyrighting it, Paxton allowed it to evolve and spread.<br> In this book the author draws upon her own experience and research to explain the art of contact improvisation, in which dance partners propel movement by physical contact. They roll, fall, spiral, leap, and slip along the contours and momentum of moving bodies. The text begins with a history, then describes the elements that define this form of dance. Subsequent chapters explore how contact improvisation relates to self and identity; how class, race, gender, culture and physiology influence dance; how dance promotes connection in a culture of isolation; and how it relates to the concept of community. The final chapter is a collection of exercises explained in the words of teachers from across the United States and abroad. Appendix A describes how to set up and maintain a weekly jam; Appendix B details recommended reading, videos and Web sites.<br></p><p><b>Cheryl Pallant</b> is a dancer, dance critic, writer, energy practitioner, somatic coach and teacher at the University of Richmond in Virginia."Recommended." --<i>Choice</i><br><br>"Fantastic...a book to treasure." --<i>Proximity</i></p><h2>A Reader&#39;s Guide to Wallace Stevens</h2><p><p>Wallace Stevens is one of the major poets of the twentieth century, and also among the most challenging. His poems can be dazzling in their verbal brilliance. They are often shot through with lavish imagery and wit, informed by a lawyer's logic, and disarmingly unexpected: a singing jackrabbit, the seductive Nanzia Nunzio. They also spoke--and still speak--to contemporary concerns. Though his work is popular and his readership continues to grow, many readers encountering it are baffled by such rich and strange poetry.</p><br><p> Eleanor Cook, a leading critic of poetry and expert on Stevens, gives us here the essential reader's guide to this important American poet. Cook goes through each of Stevens's poems in his six major collections as well as his later lyrics, in chronological order. For each poem she provides an introductory head note and a series of annotations on difficult phrases and references, illuminating for us just why and how Stevens was a master at his art. Her annotations, which include both previously unpublished scholarship and interpretive remarks, will benefit beginners and specialists alike. Cook also provides a brief biography of Stevens, and offers a detailed appendix on how to read modern poetry.</p><br><br><p> <i>A Reader's Guide to Wallace Stevens</i> is an indispensable resource and the perfect companion to <i>The Collected Poems of Wallace Stevens</i>, first published in 1954 in honor of Stevens's seventy-fifth birthday, as well as to the 1997 collection <i>Wallace Stevens: Collected Poetry and Prose</i>.</p></p><p><p>"It looks to be an invaluable companion for readers of a great poet whom many find difficult, although attractive. I am most happy to have this splendid book in my library--where it will be in use as often as on the shelf. And I shall certainly be recommending it to colleagues and friends."<b>--Alastair Fowler, professor emeritus, University of Edinburgh</b></p><p>"This is a much-needed book that offers a comprehensive guide to the poetry of Wallace Stevens. For each poem, Cook offers a brief general comment, then a series of glosses on difficult phrases and obscure references. Both comments and glosses are by turns incisive, erudite, and witty, and often shed more light on the poems than much more drawn-out and elaborate commentaries. Cook's prose is elegantly spare and direct. Her guide allows at every point for multiple meanings and resonances."<b>--Roger Gilbert, Cornell University</b></p><p>"New readers of Stevens must own this book, the ideal guide for starting out. . . . Cook's succinct summaries and annotations are confidently expert. . . . Long admired for her attention to syntactical word-play, Cook has a fine way here of describing meter as an aspect of form. . . . The book is littered with many . . . marvelous condensations. . . .

But while some of the stories may sound as if they&#x2019;ve been told time and again&#x2014;such as variations on Cinderella and Puss in Boots&#x2014;many will enchant English-language readers and storytellers for the first time. From &#x201c;The Pot of Basil&#x201d; to &#x201c;The Talking Belly,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Little Mouse with the Stinky Tail&#x201d; to &#x201c;Peppi, Who Wandered out into the World,&#x201d; the stories in <i>Catarina the Wise</i> range from simple tales of getting a new dress or something good to eat to fantastical plots for outwitting domineering husbands, rescuing impoverished fathers, or attracting wealthy suitors (frequently the Prince of Portugal). Many feature strong, clever women (usually daughters who become queen). Many are funny; many are wise.

But in this rigorous re&#x2013;investigation of the Battle of Britain, Stephen Bungay tells a story full of revelations. Whether assessing the development of radar or the relative merits of the Spitfire, Hurricane, and Messerschmitt, he uncovers the unexpected truth behind many time&#x2013;honored myths. Not only a major work of modern history but also a truly compelling narrative, <b>The Most Dangerous Enemy</b> confirms the Battle of Britain as a crucial event in European history.Stephen Bungay was born in Kent in 1954 and educated at Oxford and T�bingen. He has spent his career working for the Boston Consulting Group in London and Munich as a chief executive in an insurance company. He is now working in executive education, specialising in military history and modern management practice. His first book, The Most Dangerous Enemy: A History of the Battle of Britain, published by Aurum in 2001 has now become accepted as the definitive book on the subject.

Unfortunately, the resolutions of the intriguing puzzles the author crafts for the great detective are almost all unsatisfying, if not downright silly. The first sign of trouble comes in Dr. Watson&#39;s preface, in which Watson claims that Holmes &#34;came to the conclusion that it was really no concern of his whether Moriarty had ceased to exist or not.&#34; But things really go off the rails in the second story, &#34;A Case of Criminal Madness,&#34; in which Holmes thwarts a villain&#39;s bioweapons with some of his own.

On August 9 another bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Fifty years have passed since these catastrophic events, and the bombings still remain highly controversial. The official justification for using these weapons was that they prevented enormous losses on both sides by avoiding an Allied invasion of Japan. Many diplomatic historians, however, have asserted that the bombings were unnecessary. One extreme argument is that Truman knew the Japanese were ready to surrender but wanted to use the bombs to intimidate the Soviet Union. Robert Maddox examines all these claims in Weapons for Victory as he strives to dispel the many myths that have been accepted as fact.<br>In addition to Maddox's valuable recasting of the circumstances leading to the bombings, he also confronts the proposed Smithsonian Enola Gay exhibit with careful historical analysis.</p><p>Robert James Maddox is Professor of History at Pennsylvania State University.The controversy over the atomic bombing of Japan is heating up as the 50th anniversary approaches. In his well-considered study of the 1945 bombings, Maddox (The United States and World War II) exposes what he feels are distortions. The most outrageous, in his opinion: that President Truman, convinced by advisers that the bomb was not needed to force Japan's surrender, deliberately prolonged the war until he could deploy the new weapon against Japan-to cow the Soviets. Maddox concludes that the President ordered the bomb dropped for the very reasons he stated: to bring the war to an end as soon as possible and thus avoid the massive casualties of an invasion. Commenting on "the fondness of many academics for tales of conspiracy in high places," the author credibly refutes several of the more prevalent theories about the bomb, demonstrating, for instance, that American officials were not aware of the effect radiation fallout would have on the inhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Seven Natural Wonders of the World: A Pop-Up Book</h2><p>A companion to the popular book <i>The Seven Ancient Wonders of the World, </i>this attractive fine-art pop-up book ingeniously portrays some of the most remarkable landmarks of the natural world.

There, as she tries to achieve independence from both outer necessity and inward grief, she finds that her feelings for a worldly doctor and a dictatorial professor threaten her hard-won self-possession. Published in 1853, Charlotte Bronte's last novel was written in the wake of her grief at the death of her siblings. It has a dramatic force comparable to that of her other masterpiece, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, as well as a striking modernity of psychological insight and a revolutionary understanding of human loneliness.</p><p>With her final novel, <i>Villette</i>, Charlotte Bronte reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, <i>Villette</i> is Bronte's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even <i>Jane Eyre</i> in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There, she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquetter. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey--a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.Arguably Bronte&#39;s most refined and deeply felt work, Villette draws on her experiences as a student in Brussels as well as her profound loneliness following the deaths of her three siblings. Lucy Snowe, the narrator of Villette, flees from an unhappy past in England to begin a new life as a teacher at a French boarding school in the great cosmopolitan capital of Villette. Soon Lucy&#39;s struggle for independence is overshadowed by both her friendship with a worldly English doctor and her feelings for an autocratic schoolmaster. Bronte&#39;s strikingly modern heroine must decide if there is any man in her society with whom she can live and still be free.</p><h2>The Storyteller&#39;s Companion to the Bible Volume 4 Old Testament Women</h2><p>Volume 4 begins a topical approach in the Storyteller&#39;s Companion series.

Williamson in EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE</p><h2>Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States</h2><p><p>Biology and politics have converged today across much of the industrialized world. Debates about genetically modified organisms, cloning, stem cells, animal patenting, and new reproductive technologies crowd media headlines and policy agendas. Less noticed, but no less important, are the rifts that have appeared among leading Western nations about the right way to govern innovation in genetics and biotechnology. These significant differences in law and policy, and in ethical analysis, may in a globalizing world act as obstacles to free trade, scientific inquiry, and shared understandings of human dignity.</p><br><p> In this magisterial look at some twenty-five years of scientific and social development, Sheila Jasanoff compares the politics and policy of the life sciences in Britain, Germany, the United States, and in the European Union as a whole. She shows how public and private actors in each setting evaluated new manifestations of biotechnology and tried to reassure themselves about their safety.</p><br><p> Three main themes emerge. First, core concepts of democratic theory, such as citizenship, deliberation, and accountability, cannot be understood satisfactorily without taking on board the politics of science and technology. Second, in all three countries, policies for the life sciences have been incorporated into "nation-building" projects that seek to reimagine what the nation stands for. Third, political culture influences democratic politics, and it works through the institutionalized ways in which citizens understand and evaluate public knowledge. These three aspects of contemporary politics, Jasanoff argues, help account not only for policy divergences but also for the perceived legitimacy of state actions.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Designs on Nature</i> is a brilliant book that represents a major contribution to a vast and growing literature on biotechnology and bioethics. Professor Jasanoff tackles a complex topic with ease and humor that will appeal to students, scholars, and decision makers. There is nothing else available that comes close to her rich and detailed analysis."<b>--Paulette Kurzer, University of Arizona, author of <i>Markets and Moral Regulation</i></b></p><p>"Jasanoff provides an excellent guide to the public and political issues arising from biotechnology while also addressing the wider context of scientific governance and what has become known as the 'public understanding of science.' She makes a powerful and persuasive case both for the social and political significance of biotechnology and for a specific form of scholarly analysis that is both theoretically informed and empirically aware. Highly readable and very informative for those who have little background knowledge of these issues (and indeed for those with substantial background), this book will become the standard text on the political management of biotechnology and the politics of science and technology more broadly."<b>--Alan Irwin, University of Liverpool, author of <i>Sociology and the Environment and Citizen Science</i></b></p><p>"Using the interdisciplinary resources of Science and Technology Studies in an intellectually subtle, rigorous, and empirically sensitive way across three different national arenas, Sheila Jasanoff here provides an unequalled comparative perspective on the common yet differential struggles of modern political cultures and their institutions to get to grips with the challenges of controlling biological scientific knowledge practices in the public interest. She deftly exposes and insightfully explores the twin projects wherein modern scientific knowledge and its institutional and cultural contexts tacitly coproduce each other, whilst constructing the domains of scientific knowledge and cultural politics as if categorically distinct. A further key twist is provided by Jasanoff in the exposure of the tacit processes whereby policy and scientific institutions at the same time produce imagined idioms of their respective publics and democratic cultural arenas. This book offers crucial resources, and challenges, to several disciplines, notably political science, public law, anthropology, policy analysis and sociology--not to mention to the life sciences themselves."<b>--Brian Wynne, Lancaster University</b></p><b>Sheila Jasanoff</b> is Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies at Harvard University's John F.

Modern society brings people together in a variety of settings and injects an active state presence into all manner of everyday activities. Inevitably there are disputes. Yet, these disputes settle all around us, based on social norms or simply an understanding of what is right and what is wrong; what is contestable and what is not. This private ordering of responsibility occurs against a backdrop, sometimes but certainly not always invoked, of what might occur were the matter to be taken to the more costly system of public dispute resolution. In this sense, disputants outside the legal system are said to be bargaining in the shadow of the law. For those who cannot privately order their disputes, there are two public interests. The first is to provide a public resolution such that future similarly situated disputants may be better able to anticipate what are the likely outcomes should they proceed to litigation. The second is to provide finality so that the disputants may get on with their affairs. The central thrust of this book will be to examine the overall structure of public dispute resolution through six basic concepts:<br><blockquote>1. rudimentary fairness and the trade off between equity and efficiency;<br>2. defining the parameters of a dispute in terms of the presentation of issues and the obtaining of information;<br>3. defining the scope of the dispute in terms of parties, particularly as the judicial system confronts increasingly complex litigation;<br>4. defining the power of the courts;<br>5. securing finality; and<br>6. the costs of procedure.<br></blockquote></p><p></p><h2>Forty Stories (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>William H.

It includes pieces such as the famous "Sentence," (a single, several-page-long, unfinished sentence), "The Flight of Pigeons From the Palace," one of the writer's illustrated stories, and "Overnight To Many Distant Cities."Donald Barthelme (1931-1989) published twelve books, including two novels and a prize-winning children's book. He was a regular contributor to the <b>New Yorker</b> and taught creative writing at the University of Houston. In his career, he won a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Book Award, and a National Institute of Arts and Letters Award, among others.</p><h2>Exceptional C++ Style: 40 New Engineering Puzzles, Programming Problems, and Solutions</h2><p><p> </p><p>Software "style" is about finding the perfect balance between overhead and functionality... elegance and maintainability... flexibility and excess. In <b> <i>Exceptional C++ Style</i> </b>, legendary C++ guru Herb Sutter presents 40 new programming scenarios designed to analyze not only the what but the why and help you find just the right balance in your software. </p> <p>Organized around practical problems and solutions, this book offers new insight into crucial C++ details and interrelationships, and new strategies for today's key C++ programming techniques--including generic programming, STL, exception safety, and more. You'll find answers to questions like:</p> <ul> <li>What can you learn about library design from the STL itself?</li> <li>How do you avoid making templated code needlessly non-generic?</li> <li>Why shouldn't you specialize function templates? What should you do instead? </li> <li>How does exception safety go beyond try and catch statements?</li> <li>Should you use exception specifications, or not? </li> <li>When and how should you "leak" the private parts of a class?</li> <li>How do you make classes safer for versioning? </li> <li>What's the real memory cost of using standard containers?</li> <li>How can using const really optimize your code?</li> <li>How does writing inline affect performance? </li> <li>When does code that looks wrong actually compile and run perfectly, and why should you care?</li> <li>What's wrong with the design of std::string?</li> </ul> <p> <b> <i>Exceptional C++ Style</i> </b> will help you design, architect, and code with style--and achieve greater robustness and performance in all your C++ software.</p> <br> <br> <p></p></p><p>Herb Sutter may well know the C++ programming language better than anyone else. He's worked with the language for years; he sits on its international standards committee; he works on the Microsoft Visual C++ team--his list of qualifications is astounding. That is, however, only part of the reason you should pay attention to <i>Exceptional C++ Style</i>. A more important reason is that he understands how to teach software developers: To wit, he issues challenges and dares the programmers to figure them out. Sutter grasps the importance of not lecturing smart people, and knows that guided exploration goes a very long way.<p> To give an example of Sutter's challenges (40 of them, graded by difficulty, appear in this dense book) would take more space than is available here. Know, however, that while some of them deal with obscure parts of C++, most do not, and the majority of the challenges deal with aspects of the language you use all the time. Sutter's approach doesn't consist exclusively of challenges and solutions, either--the author takes time to distill the exercises into design recommendations, making it easy for programmers to remind themselves of what they've learned. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: How to take a journeyman's skill with C++ and turn it into something more masterly, by exploring the behavior of C++ and its various parts in detail.

The contributions of all of the major social thinkers are considered in this thoughtful and integrative look at the classical roots of religious thought. </p><p> It was in the course of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment that social thinkers began to study religion from a rational, scientific, and critical standpoint. The thinkers of the Enlightenment held firmly to the conviction that the mind could comprehend the forces of nature and that humans could control those forces and employ them for their needs. Reason became the deity of these philosophers, who were enormously inspired by the scientific achievements of the preceding centuries, notably by the discoveries of Newton based on logic and empirical evidence. </p> <p> Science in the hands of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton had revealed the workings of the natural laws in the physical world. This suggested to social philosophers that perhaps similar laws might be discoverable in the social and cultural world. The French thinkers, called <i>philosophes,</i> therefore proceeded to analyze all social, political, and religious institutions, subjecting them to merciless criticism from the standpoint of reason. For the philosophes, institutions were reasonable only so long as they harmonized with human nature, only so long as they promoted the perfectibility of the individual. Unreasonable institutions prevented human beings from realizing their potential. The philosophes therefore waged an intellectual war against the irrational, employing criticism as their primary weapon. They fought against superstition, bigotry, and intolerance; they condemned censorship and demanded freedom of thought; they attacked the privileges of the monarchy and the feudal classes and their restraints upon the commercial and manufacturing classes; and they endeavored to secularize ethics and morality. In a word, their faith in reason and science led them to be humanitarian, optimistic, and confident. </p> <p> To appreciate what was distinctively novel about the Enlightenment as an intellectual movement, we need to see how it contrasted with the medieval outlook. The medieval aim in seeking knowledge was to discover God's intentions for his creation. Even the most rational of the medieval thinkers conceded that there were sacred areas into which they must not venture, spheres in which revelation, faith, and ecclesiastical authority offered the answers and gave the orders. Scientific curiosity as applied to those spheres was an unwelcome intrusion into holy ground. It was this inviolable domain of the <i>sacred</i> that distinguished the Middle Ages at their most scientific and skeptical moments from the later ages of criticism. The medieval mind was dominated by the church, literally, intellectually, and emotionally. In contrast to the medieval era, the thinkers of the Enlightenment regarded all aspects of human life and works as subject to critical examination. </p> <p> In their attitude toward religion as toward other institutions, there was diversity among these thinkers. One must not think of the Enlightenment as a monolith. Some of these thinkers were, ostensibly, agnostic. Montesquieu, for example, argued that if there is a God, he must necessarily be just. For Montesquieu, a "law," whether in nature or in society, referred to "the necessary relations deriving from the nature of things." It followed, for Montesquieu, that "justice is a true relation between two things: the relation is always the same, no matter who examines it, whether it be God, or an angel, or lastly man himself."1 Aiming thus to secularize ethics and morality, Montesquieu continues: "Thus if there were no God, we would still be obliged to venerate justice, that is, we should do everything possible to resemble that being of whom we have such an exalted notion and who, if he exists, would necessarily be just. Free though we might be from the yoke of religion, we should never be free from the bonds of equity" (106). </p> <p> Others among the Enlightenment thinkers were thoroughgoing materialists and atheists. Baron d'Holbach, for instance, contended that the unavoidable verdict of common sense upon religious views is that they have no foundation; "that all religion is an edifice in the air; that theology is only the ignorance of natural causes reduced to system; that it is a long tissue of chimeras and contradictions" (.141). For Holbach, there is only one criterion by which to assess a system of morals, and that is whether it conforms to human nature and needs. If it conforms, it is good; if it fails to conform, it should be rejected as contrary to the well-being of our species. Hence, for Holbach, there is no reason to suppose that an atheist cannot have a moral conscience. </p> <p> La Mettrie was another materialist and- atheist who published a book entitled <i>Man a Machine.</i> "The human body," he proposed, "is a machine which winds itself up" (205). Employing this mechanistic metaphor, La Mettrie held that all talk about a soul separate from the body is nonsense. Without food the soul pines away and dies together with the body. </p> <p> But there were also prominent Enlightenment thinkers who retained a religious outlook. In a letter to Ezra Stiles, a fellow member of the American Philosophical Society and president of Yale College, Benjamin Franklin stated his own personal creed: "I believe in one God, Creator of the universe. That he governs it by his Providence. That he ought to be worshipped. That the most acceptable service we render to him is doing good to his other children. That the soul of man is immortal, and will be treated with justice in another life respecting its conduct in this" (166). </p> <p> Thomas Paine also retained a personal religious creed, the essentials of which he stated in <i>The Age of Reason:</i> </p> <p> </p> I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond<br>this life. <p></p> <p> I believe in the equality of man, and I believe that religious<br> duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make<br> our fellow-creatures happy . . . . </p> <p> I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish church, by<br> the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by<br> the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind<br> is my own church. (175) </p> <p></p> <p> If we compare the forms the Enlightenment assumed in Britain, America, Germany, and France, there can be no doubt that it was in France that the conflict of the Enlightenment with the Establishment became the most intense and dramatic. Typically, it was the French philosophe who was most uncompromising in his opposition to the old regime&#x2014;the monarchy, the nobility, and the church. The philosophes tore down the old regime intellectually, thus paving the way for its actual destruction by the revolution of 1789. </p> <p> In France more than elsewhere the struggle between the philosophes and the old regime became especially harsh. The issues were not only social and political but also religious. Indeed, often the religious issues were the most salient. In mid-eighteenth-century France two bitterly opposed camps confronted one another. On the one side stood the authoritarian and intolerant Catholic Church, and on the other stood the predominantly irreligious philosophes. </p> <p> It is in this context that the writings of Rousseau on religion stand out as distinctive and extraordinarily significant. Most of Rousseau's friends among the philosophes were anti-Christian deists or even atheists. The atheists, as we have seen, proposed that one can reject the belief in God and yet possess a conscience and conduct oneself in accordance with the basic ethical and moral principles. The materialists and atheists denied the existence of an ethical Deity and Teacher but nevertheless accepted the moral principles that originated in the belief in such a Deity. Rousseau, however, discerned certain disturbing implications in the more extreme materialist views: Do not such views carry with them the danger of leading to a moral vacuum or to moral relativism? If we may state what disturbed Rousseau in the words of a later thinker, it would be: "If God is dead, is everything permitted?" This is, of course, the question Dostoyevsky addressed in criticism of the proto-Nietzschean characters he had created in his great philosophical novels. So it was in opposition to the extreme materialist views of his time that Rousseau sought to clarify and formulate his own religious outlook. </p> <p> Rousseau's writings on religion deserve special attention for another reason. Although he shared certain Enlightenment principles, he also anticipated several key ideas of the so-called Romantic-Conservative Reaction. This was an early nineteenth-century intellectual movement that emerged as a critical response to the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. The Romantic thinkers turned away from what they considered the naive optimism and rationalism of the eighteenth century. They did so not only by recognizing the irrational factors in human conduct but also by assigning them positive value. Tradition, imagination, feeling, and religion were now regarded as natural and positive. Deploring the disorganizing consequences of the French Revolution, the Romantic and Conservative thinkers attributed those consequences to the folly of the revolutionaries who had uncritically accepted Enlightenment assumptions and had attempted to reorder society according to rational principles alone. </p> <p> In reaction to the eighteenth-century exaltation of reason, the nineteenth century therefore extolled emotion and imagination, leading in that way to a great revival of religion, poetry, and art. Moreover, in opposition to the Enlightenment's elevation of the individual, the Romantics elevated the <i>group,</i> the <i>community,</i> and the <i>nation</i> as the most highly valued concepts. Historic memories and loyalties were viewed as binding the individual to a <i>nation,</i> a category now raised to a position of supreme importance. Gone was the cosmopolitanism of the Enlightenment. Increasingly, the nineteenth century turned to the investigation of the <i>origins</i> of existing institutions rather than to their transformation according to rational principles. A <i>historical</i> outlook emerged in which more than ever before institutions were regarded as the product of slow, organic development, and not of deliberate, rational, calculated construction. </p> <p> Although the Romantic movement was evident throughout Europe, its form varied from one country to another. In England and especially in Germany, the movement reflected a strong national reaction to the radicalism of the Enlightenment as it manifested itself in the Revolution and Napoleonic expansionism. In general, the Enlightenment conception of a rational, <i>mechanistic</i> universe was now rejected. In every area of culture&#x2014;literature, art, music, philosophy, and religion&#x2014;an effort was made to free the emotions and the imagination from the austere rules and conventions imposed during the eighteenth century. In religion, the importance of inner experience was restored; in philosophy, the mind was assigned a creative role in shaping the world. </p> <p> This movement, beginning with the writings of Rousseau and Hume and developing further with the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, expressed a shift in emphasis from the mechanistic universe of Newton to the creative character of the personality. The aim of this movement was to liberate the mind from the purely rationalist mode of thinking. Rousseau was a pioneer in that regard. He was less inclined than most of his colleagues among the philosophes to counsel the reconstruction of society in accordance with abstract, rational principles alone. Inner moral will, conscience, and conviction were for him also important for human liberation. </p> <p> The foregoing historical background will prove to be useful in our later discussion of Hegel and his critics. Indeed, because Hegel, the Left-Hegelians, Marx, Nietzsche, and Max Weber were German intellectuals, we shall need to provide more background, showing how the Enlightenment and the Romantic Reaction expressed themselves in the German context. First, however, we need a full exposition of Rousseau's religious philosophy, which is important not only in its own right but also because it profoundly influenced Hegel and other thinkers considered in later chapters. </p></p><h2>The Anglo-Dutch Moment: Essays on the Glorious Revolution and its World Impact</h2><p>Much new research and writing on the Glorious Revolution of 1688-91 in England, Scotland, Ireland and North America, and on the Dutch role in the Revolution, has materialized in the last few years in connection with the tercentenary celebrations of 1988 and 1989 and the various accompanying conferences, symposia, and exhibitions in Britain, the Netherlands and the United States. There has also been a spate of associated publications. This is, however, the first large-scale work to emerge from the tercentenary commemoration, and the first to attempt to bring together the main strands of the new research and writing for the general reader and for the student, placing the English Revolution of 1688-89 for the first time in its full British, European and American setting, and showing how fundamentally our picture of the Revolution itself, as well as the Revolutionary process of 1688-91 as a whole, is now being transformed.</p><p>This book sets the Glorious Revolution in its full British, European and American context, and to show how fundamentally our picture of the English Revolution, as well as of the Revolutionary process of 1688-91, is now being transformed....&#34;a superb volume: well-edited and indexed, and filled with useful maps, prints, and Dutch political allegories.&#34; Albion</p><h2>The Post Christian Mind : Exposing Its Destructive Agenda</h2><p>This book attempts to clarify the immense gap now opening up between Christians and the culture of the world we live in. The author explores the kinds of views, attitudes and topics of discussion that fill the mental atmosphere around us, using them to define current secularist thinking and pinpoint preconceptions that are antithetical to the Christian mind.</p><p>Since the days when Harry Blamires sat amid the smoke of his tutor and friend C.S. Lewis, the world has changed--and not, he believes, for the better. British society no longer has at its foundation the Judeo-Christian system of belief. Traditional values are undermined continually, as we witness attacks (especially from the media) on cherished notions of family, morality, sexuality, and marriage. And the church's response? Blamires is withering as he castigates "trendy vicars" for pandering to the whims of the novel.<p> "What we need," he declares, "is a Christian backlash, a vigorous response to the new paganism of the contemporary world." He pulls no punches as he seeks to describe and expose what he terms the emerging "post-Christian mind." While many argue that tolerance is essential to a healthy multiculturalism, Blamires disagrees. "The need for living harmoniously in society along with people of other faiths has encouraged a pluralism which saps confidence in the imperatives of the Christian revelation."</p><p> As he lambastes the emerging "culture of rights" and critiques contemporary perceptions of democracy, freedom, the "body beautiful," and economics, the danger is that Blamires might sound like the old man in the pub who can't stop talking about the good old days. But read closer, and you will find many fresh observations from someone who believes strongly in, and has thought hard about, what he is saying. Whether you agree with him or not, it is vital to consider where we propose to derive our values and ethics in a post-Christian society. This is certainly an explosive place to start. <i>--Brian Draper, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Harry Blamires is a highly respected teacher and author of important works including The Christian Mind and The Tyranny of Time.</p><h2>College Mathematics for Trades and Technologies (What&#39;s New in Trade Math)</h2><p><p> <i>For </i> <i>courses in Trade Math, Business Math, or Technical Mathematics.</i> </p> <p> <br> </p> <p> <b>Fosters a solid understanding of the math needed for a broad range of career programs</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>College Mathematics for Trades and Technologies </i> </b>introduces the basic math, algebra, and geometry needed in career programs, including fields such as personal finance, healthcare, and industrial trades.

The purpose of this book is to tell about that part. In successive chapters we describe what children do as they learn to act as partners in the social dance that is talking between parents and children, and how interactions change as baby talk turns into back-talk. We describe the pattern of change as the reciprocal responses of turn taking become coordinated contributions to conversation such that even when parents and children are engaged in independent tasks, they can stay and play in a dance of talking.</p><p>We are able to describe the gradual development of talking as a social dance because of the longitudinal data we collected on the everyday lives of young American children. Each month for 2-1/2 years we recorded in their homes the interactions between 42 children and their parents as the children learned to talk. We spent 10 more years creating and verifying an immense computer database in order both to preserve the priceless gift of these families' willingness to be watched and to ensure that the database would be one of a kind in the depth and scientific integrity of its information about the everyday experience of young American children. This book refines what is already known about language development by giving a fuller description based on more complete data from a much larger group of children in families more varied in size, race, and socioeconomic status (SES). But more important, this book also adds information previously unknown: a description of the social world of ambient conversation and casual interaction in which language development proceeds.</p><p>We undertook the longitudinal observations to discover what was happening to children during their first 3 years of life. We could find studies of families with special needs, families having physical, marital, or mental problems, and families subject to societal intervention related to neglect and abuse. We could find astonishingly few data, however, concerning what actually goes on in the daily lives of the well-functioning families that are the stable, unremarkable majority of Americans. As specialists in clinical language intervention, we were well aware of how different children are in terms of language resources by age 4, but we found far more theories than facts that would explain why some 4-year-olds were performing so much more proficiently than others on verbal/cognitive tasks. We assumed, wrongly as it turned out, that the early experience of most children in ordinary American families was very similar to what we and our college-educated colleagues had experienced growing up. We designed a study to measure children's early experience and find out how much talking ordinary families actually do and how often and about what parents interact with 1- to 2-year-olds in the course of taking care of their household tasks.</p><p>Even after 2-1/2 years of observing the daily lives of 42 ordinary families that all were similarly socializing their children to participate in American society, we could not see the massive differences the data revealed in the amount of talking that went on across families until we had converted our observations into quantified data. We were further surprised at how consistent the relative quantity of talking was in a family over time such that we could calculate how much experience with words a child was accumulating month by month while learning to talk. The amount that parents talked with their 1- to 2-year-old children was generally correlated with the parents' SES. But the data showed that no matter what the family SES, the more time parents spent talking with their child from day to day, the more rapidly the child's vocabulary was likely to be growing and the higher the child's score on an IQ test was likely to be at age 3.</p><p>When we analyzed what was happening in the families such that the amount of talking differed so greatly, we saw that all of the families devoted similar amounts of talk to socializing their children, getting them properly fed and dressed, and keeping them safe and appropriately engaged. The added amounts of talk we recorded in some of the more talkative families concerned topics other than the giving and getting necessary in everyday life, and it was this extra, optional talk that was highly correlated with measures of the children's verbal/cognitive competence at age 3. The data showed that when parents and children were staying to talk together with no need beyond social interaction, much more was happening than children hearing and saying words and sentences or learning reference and the names of things. Most of the optional talk occurred when parents and children were partners in mutual or parallel activities in which accomplishing something was rewarding but not imperative, doing a puzzle, for instance, or the child picking out socks to try on as the parent folded laundry. As partners in play, the children tended to be more cooperative, the parents more approving, and both of them less demanding and more likely to comment on nuances and elaborate what was said. The prohibitions required to manage the children's behavior were diluted by the amount of talk about a shared activity, and the vocabulary and concepts embedded in the talk were, without planning or effort, contributing to the accumulation of language and cognitive accomplishments that later tests would measure.</p><p>Even as we focused on the importance of the amount of experience with language and interaction parents provided their children before age 3, we knew that was only part of the story and that we would have to write this book to describe the importance of the children's contributions to the amount and kinds of experience their parents provided. In this book we have focused on the children learning from their interactions how to talk and thus influence their experience. But this too is only part of the story. The whole story is the intimate social dance between children and parents interacting as partners, listening and speaking, following and leading, locked into the ways language works between people. As children learn to talk they become increasingly heterogeneous dance partners: each learns the social dance of his or her own family culture that governs what its members talk about, how much, and in what circumstances.</p><p>The amount of time the children and parents spent dancing together above and beyond what was needed to take care of everyday necessities influenced not only the amount of language experience the parents provided but also the amount of the children's practice using language. All of the children had ample practice using words and constructions to get the objects and attention they wanted and to influence how they were dressed and cared for. The extra talk we recorded in the parents' data began to appear in the children's data when the children started using words to explore how things work and how people respond. We began to record dances devoted to persuasion and resistance as 2-year-olds, encouraged both to act independently and to conform to society's rules, began choosing to do neither. But most often we saw children exploring the words that would entice their parents into a dance and prolong it once it began. The data showed the talkativeness of the parents becoming the talkativeness of the children.</p><p>Talkativeness affected the amount the children learned more than the language development of the children: the size of the vocabulary and the range of expression more than the words and constructions the children began to use. Talkativeness affected both the frequency of the social dance and its elaboration as the children's display of increasing knowledge drew automatically more complex responses from their parents. Talkativeness provided the children with more language experience in increasingly sophisticated social dances with expert partners whose willingness to dance encouraged both the children's talkativeness and their assurance that they were important, competent, and understood. Self-confident, talkative 2-year-olds began to use their skills, though, not only to share new discoveries with their parents but also to manipulate them and weary them with a profusion of self-centered comments. Parents who had things they needed to do and other adults available to talk with began leaving the children to practice with their toys or their siblings. The parents had gotten from their investment in dancing what they would need when their children went from the safety of home to the outside world full of mysteries and temptations: children intent on exploring experience who could and would talk with their parents about what was happening to them.</p><p>Our observations showed us children growing up and learning to talk in preexisting social worlds that were continuing to develop around them. Each child was added to a family whose members each had friends, interests, and obligations that did not include the child. Learning to talk opened the gate to the more complex and exciting world on view in the family, and the children applied all of their cognitive resources to practicing until they gained full access. This book describes the pattern of the children's practice, its influence on the amount of language experience their parents provided, and the increasing extent to which the children were determining their own outcomes. For the children, mastery of the social world began with taking up talking.</p><p>Excerpted from chapter 1 of <b>The Social World of Children Learning to Talk,</b> by Betty Hart, Ph.D., &amp; Todd R.

It is a classic study of an American business aristocracy of colonial stock with Protestant affiliations as well as an analysis of how fabulously wealthy nineteenth-century family founders in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, supported various exclusive institutions that in the course of the twentieth century produced a national upper-class way of life. But as that way of life became an end of itself, instead of an effort to consolidate power and control, the upper-class outlived its function; this, argues Baltzell, is precisely what took place in the Philadelphia class system.</p> <p><em>Philadelphia Gentlemen</em> emphasizes that class is largely a matter of family, whereas an elite is largely a matter of individual achievement. The emphasis in Philadelphia on old classes, in contrast to the emphasis in New York and Boston on individual achievement and elite striving, helps to explain the dramatically different outcomes of ruling class domination in major centers of the Eastern Establishment. In emphasizing class membership or family prestige, the dynamics of industrial and urban life passed by rather than through Philadelphia. As a result in the race for urban preeminence, Philadelphia lost precious time and eventually lost the struggle for ruling preeminence as such.</p> <p>When the book initially appeared, it was hailed by <em>The New York Times</em> as &#x201c;a very, very important book.&#x201d; Writing in the pages of the <em>American Sociological Review</em>, Seymour Martin Lipset noted that &#x201c;<em>Philadelphia Gentlemen</em> says important things about class and power in America, and says them in ways that will interest and fascinate both sociologists and laymen.&#x201d; And in the <em>American Historical Review</em>, Baltzell&#x2019;s book was identified simply as &#x201c;a gold mine of information.&#x201d; In short, for sociologists, historians, and those concerned with issues of culture and the economy, this is indeed a classic of modern social science.</p></p><p><p><em>E.

Using a resource-based perspective, their concept of competence allows a proactive construction of competence, spanning multiple businesses and observes competition as being over the acquisition and development of competence.Competence-Based Competition Edited by Gary Hamel London Business School, UK and Aim� Heene De Vlerick School voor Management, Belgium This volume deals with the beginning of a new era in the theory of strategic management. New concepts and techniques are developed and the fundamentals of the content and the process of strategic management are questioned in depth. Using a resource-based perspective, the concept of core competence: <ul> <li>Allows a proactive construction of competence</li> <li>Perceives competence as spanning multiple businesses</li> <li>Observes competition as being over the acquisition and development of competence</li> </ul> Contributions to the book consider the competition between strategic issues. Is strategic management about reacting, anticipating or orchestrating all resources towards the realization of the desirable future of the company? Within this field of paradigms the concept of &#x2018;core competence&#x2019; is gaining more and more importance in the area of strategic management. This book aims to show that it is necessary to have a sound theory of strategic management which has pragmatic relevance, face validity for the business community and close links to the daily practice of strategic management. Competence-based Competition will be of enormous benefit to undergraduates and graduates on management courses.</p><h2>In Her Kitchen: Stories and Recipes from Grandmas Around the World: A Cookbook</h2><p><b>Winner of the James Beard Award for Photography&nbsp;<br><br>In a keepsake volume, Gabriele Galimberti&#x2019;s beautiful portraits of grandmothers from all over the world with their signature recipes illustrates the universal language of food and family.<br><br></b>On the eve of a photography trip around the world, Gabriele Galimberti sat down to dinner with his grandmother Marisa.

Chapters discuss matching assessment to curriculum needs, provides guidelines and examples, and offer step-by-step rubics and checking processes. Any educator's library needs this." - <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>"The weakest link in the inclusion of critical skills in the curriculum has been assessment. These skills that are so necessary for the workplace and personal life include problem solving, critical thinking, and self-assessment, as well as locating, evaluating, and communicating information. Assessing these sklls, however, requires different instruments from the traditional test. This professional book is a toolkit for the educator who is willing to incorporate critical skills into instruction, but who needs assistance in creating authentic assessments or is looking for new ideas in testing instruments. An explanation of authentic assessments is followed by steps in the development of instruments for evaluation of skill development. Formative and summative assessments are given for each scenario. Rubrics for rating performance for a variety of tasks across the curriculum are a key part of this book. These rubrics include solo audition, evaluation of research claims, paragraph task, and analyzing group collaboration. One chapter focuses on assessing the ability to monitor one's progress and performance, while other chaptes focus on measuring information literacy skills and collaborative skills. Educators who are familiar with current research in curriculum development and assessment will recognize many names in the extensive list of references. It will be a very valuable professional resource for any library serving educators. Classroom teachers and curriculum developers will probably want their personal copies as well." - <i>VOYA</i></p><h2>The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)</h2><p>The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany presents a richly illustrated, integrated, chronological account of German history from Charlemagne to the modern era. Written in a lively, accessible manner for a general audience by a leading academic expert, this book is unique in its authority, approach and scope. Martin Kitchen focuses particularly on the German people - their culture and society. In this way he illuminates and puts into perspective the country&#39;s political history, from its origins as a collection of small, German-speaking states to its present-day status as a major European and world power. In special illustrated boxes and panels throughout the book, he reveals the great cultural and intellectual contribution Germans have made to the world through the works of figures such as Martin Luther, Bach, Kant, Wagner, and Gropius.</p><p>The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany presents a richly illustrated, integrated, chronological account of German history from Charlemagne to the modern era. Unique in its approach and scope, the book focuses on German culture, illuminating and putting into perspective the country&#39;s varied political history.A splendidly written narrative, this glossy volume can attract the attention of new students <i>and</i> veteran scholars of the wild ups and downs of German history. Aided by a plethora of color images, Kitchen exerts his appeal by keeping before the reader the abiding questions of the country's identity: who is a German, and where is Germany? Answering these questions, Kitchen delivers an interpretive accounting of political structures from the Holy Roman Empire to the latest reunified state. Necessarily simplifying without being simplistic, the author touches the essentials that have shaped, and haunted, the country: Luther, the Reformation, the Thirty Years War, the ascendance of Prussia, the Napoleonic impact, and the disasters of the twentieth century. All is not goose-stepping and war, though. Kitchen encapsulates in illustrated sidebars the Germans' signal cultural achievements in music, painting, and literature, spanning such varied artists as Bach and Grosz. With such breadth combined with depth in the crucial periods, Kitchen offers libraries an excellent resource. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Writers Inc.

That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products. Hoffman continues to be hands-on in the company, still writing, still envisioning, and still putting kids, parents, and teachers first.</p>Wonderful, Colorful <br>Excellent!!

Made over the past several years with an 8x10 camera, the star images are hour-long exposures with the camera mounted on a clock drive so that the stars are rendered as dots instead of streaks. The sun and moon images are made with a telescope attached to Bosworth's camera.</p><p>Speaking of her inspiration for these series, Bosworth writes: "Every clear night of the summer my father would go out for a walk to look at the night sky. Many nights I would join him. We knew the North Star, and the Big Bear, but the rest became our own. At times we stood still for an hour or more to watch for shooting stars. We had no agenda. It was all about amazement at a sky full of stars. With this sense of wonder, I began making photographs of the Heavens. In these days of the Hubble Telescope and its spectacular imagery from deep space, I wanted a reminder of the mystery of our own night sky."</p><p>The book also includes facsimile editions of three artist's books that Bosworth has made as a nod to Galileo's 17th-century publications in which he first observed the skies through a telescope.</p></p><p></p><h2>Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis</h2><p>Research on fundamental learning processes continues to tell an important and interesting story. In the second edition of <em>Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis</em>, Mark Bouton recounts that story, providing an in-depth but highly readable review of modern learning and behavior theory that is informed by the history of the field. The text reflects the author's conviction that the study of animal learning has a central place in psychology, and that understanding its principles and theories is important for students, psychologists, and scientists in related disciplines (e.g., behavioral neuroscience and clinical psychology).<br><br>Almost all of the chapters are organized to illustrate how knowledge is accumulated through the systematic development of theory and research. The book opens with a brief history that connects the modern issues with their philosophical and biological roots. Chapter 2 addresses the idea that basic learning processes are designed to help an organism adapt to a changing world; in the process, it introduces the reader to a wide range of interesting examples of learning. After analyzing some fundamental phenomena in Pavlovian learning, the book then provides a very clear and readable review of modern conditioning theories since the Rescorla-Wagner model, discusses memory retrieval and behavior-system processes that govern performance, and addresses the question of whether the laws of learning and behavior uncovered in the laboratory maze and Skinner box have generality-by studying learning in honey bees and categorization and causal judgments and proposition learning in humans. Instrumental learning is then discussed from various perspectives in chapters on behavior and its consequences (research in behavior analysis and behavioral economics), how stimuli guide instrumental action (a survey of the field of animal cognition), and how motivation influences instrumental action. The final chapter reviews and integrates the major themes of the book, describing avoidance learning, learned helplessness, and related examples of learning before reviewing the modern cognitive and synthetic perspective on instrumental action.<br><br>Lively and current, <em>Learning and Behavior: A Contemporary Synthesis</em>, Second Edition, engages students while illustrating the interconnectedness of topics within the field and the excitement of modern research.<br><br><strong>For Students</strong><br><br>Companion Website<br><br>The <em>Learning and Behavior</em>, Second Edition, Companion Website includes resources to help students learn and review the content of each chapter and test their understanding of the concepts presented in the textbook.

Lawson Green &amp; Gold Professor of Psychology at the University of Vermont. He is a leading researcher in the field of animal learning, cognition, and behavior. He received his B.A. from Williams College and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington. For many years, his research has investigated the relationships between context, conditioning, memory, and motivation, with a special emphasis on inhibitory processes like extinction. Some of his scientific writing has focused on the connections between modern learning theory, neuroscience, and issues in cognitive behavioral therapy (e.g., panic disorder, fear and anxiety, relapse after therapy). He has been a Fulbright Scholar, a James McKeen Cattell Scholar, a University Scholar at the University of Vermont, and a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (Stanford), and he is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. He was Editor of the <em>Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes</em>, the field's most prestigious journal, from 1998 until 2003. He has taught an up-to-date course in Learning, which is given away in his book, for over three decades.<br>Mark E. Bouton, one of the most influential figures in modern learning research, has written a book that aims to convey to students the complex reality of his field.

Its aftershocks are still being felt today. Through the work of such directors as Jean-Luc Godard and Fran�ois Truffaut, filmmakers came to be seen as outstanding artists rather than mere studio technicians, paving the way for contemporary cinematic auteurs such as Martin Scorsese, Pedro Almod�var, and Luc Besson. This volume begins by tracing the social and cultural changes of postwar France that gave birth to the New Wave then examines in detail the careers of artists like Alain Renais and Jean-Luc Godard. <i>The French New Wave: A New Look</i> is a concise and accessible account of a crucial movement in film history.</p><p>Naomi Greene is professor emeritus of French and film studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara and has written books on Antonin Artaud, Ren� Clair, and Pier Paolo Pasolini.The Volume is noteworthy...

Thrillingly held together by its dramatic plot and lavish, operatic setting, it is a multi-layered fiction of deceptive simplicity. For a rich young prince and his loyal companion, Venice promises nothing but unfettered pleasure until they encounter a mysterious masked Armenian who delivers them a strange prophecy. And when his words prove true, this enigmatic figure develops a deeply sinister influence over them, drawing them into darker forms of magic.&#x201d; As the narrative progresses, it become increasingly unclear whether the apparitions the prince sees are the manifestations of a troubled spirit world or simply an elaborate hoax. Friedrich von Schiller is one of the leading figures of 18th-century German literature, most famous for his dramatic works <i>The Robbers, Mary Stuart,</i> and <i>William Tell.</i></p><p>Hesperus Press, as suggested by their Latin motto, <i>Et remotissima prope,</i> is dedicated to bringing near what is far&#x2014;far both in space and time. Works by illustrious authors, often unjustly neglected or simply little known in the English&#x2013;speaking world, are made accessible through a completely fresh editorial approach and new translations.

Marx, Freud and Lenin had such an influence, and so, Alister McGrath argues, does John Calvin.

It traces Calvin's remarkable impact on the development of modern Western attitudes to work, wealth, civil rights, capitalism and the natural sciences. <p>Published to wide critical acclaim in hardback and now available in paperback, this ground-breaking study of Calvin will be welcomed by all concerned with an understanding of the shaping of modern western culture.</p><b>Alister E.

But this, Mitchel Abolafia suggests, would be a case of missing the real culture of the Street for the characters who dominate the financial news.</p><p><i>Making Markets</i>, an ethnography of Wall Street culture, offers a more complex picture of how the market and its denizens work. Not merely masses of individuals striving independently, markets appear here as socially constructed institutions in which the behavior of traders is suspended in a web of customs, norms, and structures of control. Within these structures we see the actions that led to the Drexel Burnham and Salomon Brothers debacles not as bizarre aberrations, but as mere exaggerations of behavior accepted on the Street.</p><p>Abolafia looks at three subcultures that coexist in the world of Wall Street: the stock, bond, and futures markets. Through interviews, anecdotes, and the author&#x2019;s skillful analysis, we see how traders and New York Stock Exchange &#x201c;specialists&#x201d; negotiate the perpetual tension between short-term self-interest and long-term self-restraint that marks their respective communities&#x2015;and how the temptation toward excess spurs market activity. We also see the complex relationships among those market communities&#x2015;why, for instance, NYSE specialists resent the freedoms permitted over-the-counter bond traders and futures traders.

Not merely masses of individuals striving independently, markets appear here as socially constructed institutions in which the behavior of traders is suspended in a web of customs, norms, and structures of control. Within these structures we see the actions that led to the Drexel Burnham and Salomon Brothers debacles not as bizarre aberrations, but as mere exaggerations of behavior accepted on the Street. Mitchel Abolafia looks at three subcultures that co-exist in the world of Wall Street: the stock, bond, futures markets. Through interviews, anecdotes, and the author&#39;s skillful analysis, we see how traders and New York Stock Exchange specialists negotiate the perpetual tension between short-term self-interest and long-term self-restraint that marks their respective communities - and how the temptation toward excess spurs market activity. We also see the complex relationships among those market communities - why, for instance, NYSE specialists resent the freedoms permitted over-the-counter bond traders and futures traders. Making Markets shows us that what propels Wall Street is not a fundamental human drive or instinct, but strategies enacted in the context of social relationships, cultural idioms, and institutions - a cycle that moves between phases of unbridled self-interest and collective self-restraint.Mitchel Y.

Jeffrey Alexander analyses the most general and fundamental elements of sociological thinking about action and order and their ramifications for empirical study. He insists that sociological thought need not choose between voluntary action and social constraint. </p> <p>The four volumes can be read independently of one another as each presents a distinctive theoretical argument in its own right. The first volume is directed at contemporary problems and controversies, not only in &#x2018;theory&#x2019; but in the philosophy and sociology of science. The last three volumes make interpretations, confronting the individual theorists, and the secondary literature, on their own terms. </p></p><p><p>Multivolume collection by leading authors in the field</p></p><h2>Hebrew Word Study: Beyond the Lexicon</h2><p>Many Christians long to study the Word of God in the original Hebrew. They will take Hebrew classes at a college, a synagogue, or online and often become discouraged because these classes either teach them to speak Hebrew or spend considerable time teaching complex rules of grammar when all these Christians want to do is find God&#39;s heart and message in His Word. As a result, these Christians usually give up and just go to the back of their Strong&#39;s Concordance, a lexicon, or a Bible dictionary to look up a word. This book is written for the Christian who does not want to learn to speak Hebrew or spend long hours trying to understand complex rules of grammar. All they want is to know if there is a deeper meaning to certain Hebrew words. Even after looking up a word in their lexicon, they are still left with a nagging feeling that there must be more. In most cases there is more, and this book will give some guidelines in how to drill down into the very heart, soul, and core of a Hebrew word; it will take you to a world beyond your lexicon, and you do not need a PhD to do it. The only thing you will need is to love the Word of God, and if you love it enough, it will reveal its secrets. Hebrew is a language of the heart, and if you love God enough, He will reveal His heart to you through the ancient Hebrew language.</p><p>Chaim Bentorah has a BA in Jewish studies from Moody Bible Institute, an MA in Old Testament and Hebrew from Denver Seminary, and a PhD in biblical archeology.

In this revisionist, art-historical study, Mary D. Sheriff challenges such pejorative views of Fragonard by arguing that he is better understood as an artist whose unsurpassed technical skill and witty manipulation of academic standards established a dynamic relation with the audience his art both courted and created. <br><br>Sheriff begins her inquiry with an appraisal of Fragonard criticism, followed by an extensive and thoroughly original reading of selected works by Fragonard and of the eroticism encoded in them. Art and eroticism converge in a discussion of execution, in which Sheriff explores the changing conception of execution and elucidates its complex rhetorical and cultural underpinnings. Drawing on analytic methods from contemporary critical theory and an understanding of each work's cultural milieu, Sheriff pays particular attention throughout to the relation between beholder and work of art, which she views as manifest in the artist's preoccupation with the play between the real and the fictive. Scholars and students of art history, eighteenth-century culture and history, critical theory, literary criticism, and all those drawn to the work of this great French painter will find this work essential reading.</p><p><b>Mary D.

Here, Caroline Jones&#x2019;s magisterial study widens Greenberg&#x2019;s fundamental tenet of opticality&#x2014;the idea that modernist art is apprehended through &#x201c;eyesight alone&#x201d;&#x2014;to a broader arena, examining how the critic&#x2019;s emphasis on the specular resonated with a society increasingly invested in positivist approaches to the world. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jones argues that Greenberg&#x2019;s modernist discourse developed in relation to the rationalized procedures that gained wide currency in the United States at midcentury, in fields ranging from the sense-data protocols theorized by scientific philosophy to the development of cultural forms, such as hi-fi, that targeted specific senses, one by one. Greenberg&#x2019;s attempt to isolate and celebrate the visual was one manifestation of a large-scale segmentation or bureaucratization of the body's senses. <br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyesight Alone</i> offers artists, art historians, and twentieth-century art lovers a critical history of this essential&nbsp;thinker that brings his work into dialogue with contemporary critical discourse, illuminating the contested history of modernism itself.</p><p>Even a decade after his death, Clement Greenberg remains controversial.

By asking fresh, critical, missional questions, Gorman illustrates the significance of mission as an interpretive rubric &#x2014; for Paul, for his communities, and for his contemporary interpreters.

In this book, you will not find a long series of advanced mathematical equations. There are no theory or assumptions. Instead, you will find many easy to understand graphs based on the latest ephemerides of unprecedented accuracy.<br><br>KIRKUS REVIEW<br> <br>A book that attempts to explain the motion of the moon&#x2014;a phenomenon that has baffled astronomers for quite some time.<br><br>In this work, Spolter (Gravitational Force of the Sun, 1994) delves into lunar movement. As she points out in her preface, this book isn&#x2019;t full of mathematical equations or theories; instead, it presents &#x201c;easy to understand graphs based on the latest ephemerides of unprecedented accuracy.&#x201d; The motion of the moon is a problem that has attracted many of the great astronomical and mathematical minds over the centuries. Sir Isaac Newton himself couldn&#x2019;t explain it, and the 18th century Swiss mathematician and physicist Leonard Euler abandoned his own work on it. The problem is so incredibly difficult because it&#x2019;s a &#x201c;three-body&#x201d; problem; that is, it involves the sun and the earth as well, which makes it mathematically complex from the start. Furthermore, any proposed theories can be easily compared with real-world observations, making errors immediately apparent. However, Spolter here has tools that no one before the modern era could have imagined. Atomic clocks play a key role, for example, as does lunar laser-ranging technique, as well as specialized software. Drawing on her own previously published research, Spolter provides readers with a series of graphs measuring the moon&#x2019;s periods, its perturbation by the sun, the eclipse cycle, and the &#x201c;obliquity of the ecliptic,&#x201d; among other lunar phenomena. Readers need not have advanced degrees in math or astronomy to understand it, but Spolter&#x2019;s analysis does demand one&#x2019;s full attention, and at least a high degree of familiarity with mathematical concepts and symbols. Those who don&#x2019;t have these skills may not fully appreciate the author&#x2019;s work. That said, readers who are familiar with the overall problem, and with the means that the author uses to solve it, will find it very intriguing indeed.<br><br>A complex collection of lunar data that invites interpretation and consideration.</p><p>Biography of Dr. Pari Spolter is in CONTEMPORARY AUTHORS, volume 163.</p><h2>Hemingway: The American Homecoming</h2><p>Michael Reynolds's extraordinary evocation of Hemingway's life continues in this volume, finding the American writer in Paris in 1926 and following him through the dissolution of his first marriage and the beginning of his second.<br>We witness the emergence of the public version of Hemingway and the development of a mature and major literary talent. Most significantly Reynolds reveals the radical difference between the two versions of Hemingway's male heroes. The now accepted version of these actors (tough, self-reliant, lapidary figures) is shown to be a distinct break from the earlier figures who are vulnerable, wounded survivors living precariously in a doomed world in which they have little control. These are not men with a code of behavior, nor are they strong, forceful role models. They do not make things happen. They do not fare well with women.<br>As Reynolds shows, this transition has its roots in Hemingway's own life. Hemingway's development from a rootless and insecure expatriate to the forceful figure of myth is a complex web involving his father's suicide, his second marriage and his return to America. Michael Reynolds reveals this narrative with his customary vigour, style and clarity.</p><p>This third of five planned volumes on Hemingway is no less outstanding than the previous installments, proving again that Michael Reynolds is the true Hemingway aficionado. Throughout, he adroitly mixes straight facts with deductions on his subjects' thoughts and feelings, creating a living, breathing biography that reads like a good novel. The text covers 1926-29, a transitional period that marked the conclusion of Hemingway's artistic apprenticeship and the cooling of many literary friendships; the end of one marriage and the beginning of another; the suicide of his father; and the writing of The Sun Also Rises , Men Without Women , A Farewell to Arms , and an ultimately abandoned novel. One of the book's many strengths is its juxtaposing events in Hemingway's life with the actions and emotions of his characters. This ongoing biography, destined to stand beside Richard Ellmann's portraits of Joyce and Wilde and Louis Sheaffer's volumes on O'Neill, is the stuff of which Pulitzer prizes are made. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Michael Rogers, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.This third volume in Reynolds's biography deals with the 25-month period of Hemingway's life beginning in March 1926, which saw the breakup of his marriage to his first wife, Hadley; the publication of The Sun Also Rises and his emergence from Left Bank obscurity to the status of Paris celebrity; and his marriage to Pauline Pfeiffer and the couple's return to the U.S. for the birth of his second son, Patrick. Especially interesting is the coverage of the writing of A Farewell To Arms after a never-finished novel Hemingway had put aside with 30,000 words completed. Together with the preceding two volumes, The Young Hemingway and The Paris Years, Reynolds has devoted some 826 text pages to bring his subject to within three months of his 30th birthday. His leisurely presentation is rich in detail and rendered with an accomplished narrative touch. More than any of the other biographers, Reynolds provides readers with a sense of what the "becoming" Hemingway was like and how he used his life to create his art.

This book focuses on why and how such a seemingly radical development took place.

Mencken of Dixie." "A writer this funny is dangerous," says the Raleigh News and Observer. Here Reed is in peak form as he takes a hard, often humorous look at a region he claims has created its own quasi-ethnic group: the American Southerner.<br>Is the South changing? You bet, says Reed. Industrialism, urbanization, and desegregation are just a few of the things that have changed it almost beyond recognition. In fact, one constant in the South is change. "Those who like their boundaries well defined should not attempt to talk about Southerners, " writes Reed. But for those willing to ask some difficult questions about the life and culture of the elusive Southerner, this is the place to start.<br>Where is the South? Does it begin at the Mason-Dixon Line or the "Hell, yes!" line - where people begin to answer that way when asked if they're Southerners? Is it where kudzu grows? Or where bourbon is preferred over scotch? How do Southerners come by their reputation for laziness? What happens to Southern ways when Southerners leave the South - or Yankees come to it?<br>How does the rest of the world perceive Southern women? To address that question Reed examines the Southern belles and good ol' girls who have made it into the page of Playboy. (Sorry, pictures not included.)<br>In the title piece of this collection, Reed peruses country music lyrics to explore white Southern attitudes toward violence, from more-or-less-traditional homicides - romantic triangles and lovers' quarrels - to brawls that target everything from dogs to vending machines. And he cites his own "My Tears Spoiled My Aim" as one of the great unrecorded country songs of our time: My tears spoiled my aim; that's why you're not dead. I blew a hole in the wall two feet above the bed. I couldn't see where you were at, my tears were fallin' so. I tried to shoot by ear, but y'all were lyin' low.<br>Perhaps one of the things that best defines the South is like my favorite pair of blue jeans," says Reed. "it's shrunk some, faded a bit, got a few holes in it. It doesn't look much like it used to, but it's more comfortable, and there's probably a lot of wear left in it." My Tears Spoiled My Aim will leave you chuckling - and reflecting - as one of the most perceptive observers of the South shows that no matter how much it changes, it's still the South.</p><p><p>John Shelton Reed taught for thirty-one years at the University of North Carolina, where he directed the Howard Odum Institute for Research in Social Science and helped to found the university's Center for the Study of the American South. A founding coeditor of the quarterly <i>Southern Cultures, </i>he has received many fellowships and prizes and has been president of the Southern Sociological Society and the Southern Association for Public Opinion Research. He was once a judge at the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest, and in 2001 he was elected to the Fellowship of Southern Writers. Reed has written many books including <i>Kicking Back</i> and <i>Surveying the South</i> (both with University of Missouri Press). He lives and writes in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.</p>Where exactly is the South? Why do southerners so love it? Why have more and more blacks been moving there? Is the southerner's reputation for laziness really deserved? Those who know Reed (Sociology/University of North Carolina) only as the author of Southern Folk, Plain &amp; Fancy (1986)--a vastly entertaining collection of southern stereotypes--will be gratifyingly surprised with the present essays, which effortlessly cut through a century's worth of bias to answer the above questions and more. Reed insists that to ask ``Where is the South?'' is pointless. Southerners, he contends, are America's only genuine ethnic group and are bound together by culture--patterns of diet, religion, music, manners, and the like--rather than by geography. There are sizable southern enclaves in Ypsilanti, Michigan; in Bakersfield, California; in Brooklyn; and in many other places. Asked what they like about the South, southerners who live below the Mason-Dixon Line invariably speak of the pleasant natural conditions and the amiable people: ``It's green, clean-looking, not eaten-up with pollution''; ``I have a great feeling of being respected and welcomed here.'' What about returning blacks? Reed says that the years 1963-65 evidenced a watershed reversal of white prejudice; that ``more blacks now hold public office in the South than any other region''; and that ``average black incomes in the South have exceeded those in the Midwest, and increased in the 1980's while declining elsewhere in the US.'' And as for southerners' supposed laziness, Reed notes that they watch less TV and listen to less radio than their compatriots. The author also quotes a 1973 Harris poll that found favorite pastimes to include fixing things around the house; helping others; eating; developing one's personality; having a good time with friends and family; taking naps; and ``just doing nothing.''

Ideal both for students who need basic background in US political history and students who are ready to move beyond the simple narratives they learned in secondary school, the text places major cases in their proper contexts through the integration of different types of primary sources.

As an official collector of tribute for the imperial crown, Jos� Gabriel Condorcanqui had seen firsthand what oppressive Spanish rule meant for Peru's Indian population. Adopting the Inca royal name Tupac Amaru, he set events in motion that would transform him into Latin America's most iconic revolutionary figure.</p><p>Tupac Amaru's political aims were modest at first. He claimed to act on the Spanish king's behalf, expelling corrupt Spaniards and abolishing onerous taxes. But the rebellion became increasingly bloody as it spread throughout Peru and into parts of modern-day Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. By late 1780, Tupac Amaru, his wife Micaela Bastidas, and their followers had defeated the Spanish in numerous battles and gained control over a vast territory. As the rebellion swept through Indian villages to gain recruits and overthrow the Spanish <i>corregidors</i>, rumors spread that the Incas had returned to reclaim their kingdom.</p><p>Charles Walker immerses readers in the rebellion's guerrilla campaigns, propaganda war, and brutal acts of retribution. He highlights the importance of Bastidas--the key strategist--and reassesses the role of the Catholic Church in the uprising's demise. <i>The Tupac Amaru Rebellion </i>examines why a revolt that began as a multiclass alliance against European-born usurpers degenerated into a vicious caste war--and left a legacy that continues to influence South American politics today.</p></p><p>Charles F. Walker is the MacArthur Foundation Endowed Chair in International Human Rights and Director of the Hemispheric Institute on the Americas at the University of California, Davis.The history of Spain&#x2019;s conquest and three-century grip on indigenous South America is rife with drama, but nowhere is that clash of cultures more vivid than in the story of Tupac Amaru II and his fierce, stubborn war for independence. <b>Walker</b> recreates the life of this remarkable eighteenth-century rebel with a bold sense of narrative and a careful eye for detail. Here is a fascinating study of the prevailing tensions of Tupac Amaru&#x2019;s time&#x2015;between conqueror and conquered, white and brown, city and mountain, Old World and New World&#x2015;that still vex South America today. (Marie Arana, author of <i>Bol�var: American Liberator</i>)<br><br>The Tupac Amaru Rebellion was a pivotal event in the history of the Americas, yet narrating it clearly and judiciously has evaded generations of Andean historians. <b>Charles Walker</b> seems to have broken the curse, and I have no doubt that this excellent book will instantly become the standard account. (Kris Lane, author of <i>Colour of Paradise: The Emerald in the Age of Gunpowder Empires</i>)<br><br>A masterly and authoritative history of the rebellion. <b>Walker</b>&#x2019;s empathetic portraits of Tupac Amaru and Micaela Bastidas are nuanced and convincing, and his narrative account of the revolt is both elegantly and engagingly written.

(J. H. Elliott <i>New York Review of Books</i> 2014-10-23)<br><br>The Tupac Amaru rebellion began in the Spanish viceroyalty of Peru in 1780 and turned into the largest popular uprising in Spain&#x2019;s imperial history.

(Tony Barber <i>Financial Times</i> 2014-11-28)<br><br>[This] is a coherent and thorough exploration of the causes, dynamics, and outcome of the insurgency.

Detailed study and meditation of each card may release internally all that is involved with each level encountered on the journey towards the Light. These cards may be used in conjunction with the text or separately for meditation. When studied individually, a card can reveal the necessary steps that need to be taken to actualise one&#39;s potential. Tarot cards, or symbolic representations of the truth have always been used to help man relate not only with the mind, but internally, through the feelings invoked by the colours and forms.The nature of these cards is that they can produce a strong awakening of one&#39;s unconscious forces. They are like a spiritual mirror in which we can recognise and examine ourselves. We can then understand that the reasons for our fate lie within ourselves, and changes by the mere fact that we begin to react differently to everything that happens to us. These cards with the text are a valuable key to understand our present state, our past and in a deeper sense, how we create our future. Included in the book are 22 pages of five-colour tarot illustrations.</p><p>Through her best selling book INITIATION, Elisabeth Haich is world famous for her profound understanding of the human soul and her ability to assist others on their path of actualization.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Hole in the Universe: How Scientists Peered over the Edge of Emptiness and Found Everything</h2><p>Welcome to the world of cutting-edge math, physics, and neuroscience, where the search for the ultimate vacuum, the point of nothingness, ground zero of theory, has rendered the universe deep, rich, and juicy. &#34;Modern physics has animated the void,&#34; says K. C. Cole in her entrancing journey into the heart of Nothing. Every time scientists and mathematicians think they have reached the ultimate void, new stuff appears: a black hole, an undulating string, an additional dimension of space or time, repulsive anti-gravity, universes that breed like bunnies. Cole&#39;s exploration at the edge of everything is as animated and exciting as the void itself. Take Cole&#39;s hand on this adventure into the unknown, and you&#39;ll come back informed, amused, and excited.</p><p>Most of science journalist K.C. Cole's journey into nothing is about <i>physical</i> nothing. "In the quantum realm, even nothing never sleeps. Nothing is always up to something. Even when there is absolutely nothing going on, and nothing there to do it."<p> The nothingness of the vacuum is the background to space and time. Cole shows how physicists' ideas about time, space, and reality flow out of their ideas about nothing, whether vacuum or ether. She writes with a half-smile and a glint of humor in her eye, colliding metaphors like particles at Fermilab:</p><p> </p><blockquote>.... Both space and time, individually, are as elastic as bungee cords. It was a further step, still, to see that the fabric of spacetime itself could warp under the influence of matter like hot asphalt under the tires of a heavy truck.... And then, the last straw: Not only could spacetime bend under the influence of matter, it could take matter into its own hands.</blockquote><p> Cole's book makes a wry, witty complement to Brian Greene's <i>The Elegant Universe</i>. It's an exploration of string theory (among other things) that will leave your brain only lightly tied up in knots. Or in nots. After all, as Cole writes:</p><p> </p><blockquote>Nothing may be the single most prolific idea ever to plop into the human brain.... Understanding nothing matters, because nothing is the all-important background upon which everything else happens.</blockquote><p> <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-100398-X <br></p><h2>Active-Filter Cookbook</h2><p>This Don Lancaster classic is by far the best-selling active filter book of all time.

A companion volume to his acclaimed <i>Luminous Debris, Ladder of Shadows</i> picks up where the former left off: with late antiquity, covering a period from roughly the third to the thirteenth century. Here Sobin offers brilliant readings of late Roman and early Christian ruins in his adopted region of Provence, sifting through iconographic, architectural, and sacramental vestiges to shed light on nothing less than the existential itself.</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Ladder of Shadows,</i> Gustaf Sobin is 'always in search of the kind of phenomena that might, potentially, confer sense upon one's own existence.' In the course of this search, Sobin's essays enact a lovely and compelling labor of making the past present, while also making the present unfold and open itself to history.&#x201d;&#x2015;Joshua Clover, author of <i>The Totality for Kids</i><br><br> &#x201c;Gustaf Sobin's <i>Ladder of Shadows </i>is to Proven�al consciousness what his perfect sensorium of poetry is to a rose and the sound of a river.

After some time, Timothy was sent to check on the church to see how they were. When Timothy returned with good news of their faith, love, and hope, Paul and Silas sent a letter&#x2015;now called 1 Thessalonians&#x2015;to exhort and encourage them to continue to live sanctified lives in the present in light of their splendid past and glorious future.<br><br>Yet within weeks of writing 1 Thessalonians, something happened. Somehow, unsettling theological tremors caused cracks and fissures to begin to form in the otherwise strong doctrinal and practical foundation of their newly built church. When Paul, got word of the troubles starting to nag the believers in Thessalonica, 2 Thessalonians was written to set things straight&#x2015;reminding believers to remain faithful and quelling false teaching related to the details of the end times.</p><h2>Why Geology Matters: Decoding the Past, Anticipating the Future</h2><p>Volcanic dust, climate change, tsunamis, earthquakes&#x2015;geoscience explores phenomena that profoundly affect our lives. But more than that, as Doug Macdougall makes clear, the science also provides important clues to the future of the planet. In an entertaining and accessibly written narrative, Macdougall gives an overview of Earth&#x2019;s astonishing history based on information extracted from rocks, ice cores, and other natural archives. He explores such questions as: What is the risk of an asteroid striking Earth? Why does the temperature of the ocean millions of years ago matter today? How are efforts to predict earthquakes progressing? Macdougall also explains the legacy of greenhouse gases from Earth&#x2019;s past and shows how that legacy shapes our understanding of today&#x2019;s human-caused climate change. We find that geoscience in fact illuminates many of today&#x2019;s most pressing issues&#x2015;the availability of energy, access to fresh water, sustainable agriculture, maintaining biodiversity&#x2015;and we discover how, by applying new technologies and ideas, we can use it to prepare for the future.</p><p>&#x201c;Macdougall does a masterful job of exploring the questions, dilemmas, and insights that have led to today&#x2019;s scientific understanding of the composition of our planet. His approach is not &#x201c;rocks on a shelf&#x201d; science; it&#x2019;s a compelling, interdisciplinary peek at Earth&#x2019;s prehistory&#x2015;including those processes that support so much of modern civilization.&#x201d;-Ernest Zebrowski, author of <i>Global Climate Change</i> and <i>Category 5: The Story of Camille</i><br><br>&#x201c;The story of Earth is told in such geologic forms as rock strata, volcanic eruptions, meteor craters, fossils, ocean currents, and ice flows.

While Whigs could imagine no other means of drastic constitutional reform except revolution, Quakers denied this as a legitimate option to governmental abuse of authority and advocated instead civil disobedience. This theory of a perpetual yet amendable constitution and its concomitant idea of popular sovereignty are things that most scholars believe did not exist until the American Founding. The most notable advocate of this theory was Founding Father John Dickinson, champion of American rights, but not revolution. His thought and action have been misunderstood until now, when they are placed within the Quaker tradition. This theory of Quaker constitutionalism can be traced in a clear and direct line from early Quakers through Dickinson to Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>Seventeenth-century Quakers originated a unique strain of constitutionalism, based on their theology and ecclesiology. They imagined a permanent, written constitution that was amendable through popular peaceful protest, something that most scholars believe did not exist until the American Founding.

John Hall Fish, an active participant in TWO, tells the story of one of the most exciting, controversial, and significant experiments in community control.</p><p>Founded in 1961 by a group of clergymen, with tactical advice from Saul Alinsky, TWO grew to become the major force for community development and self-government in the Woodlawn area. The author traces TWO's history as it struggled to achieve significant community control over the problems that threatened the black inner-city community. He concentrates on three controversial programs: the Youth Project (involving the Blackstone Rangers), the Woodlawn Experimental Schools project, and the Model Cities program. Although TWO ultimately failed to overcome the entrenched opposition of city agencies, its very survival, the author argues, is a measure of its success. For as the cumbersome urban bureaucracies prove ever more ineffective, it is the existence of organized and experienced community organizations that will determine the possibility of neighborhood rebirth and renewal.</p><p>Originally published in 1973.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

The injured man is discovered to be dabbling in ritual magic in an attempt to raise an ancient Egyptian queen from the dead. As the hour of his great experiment approaches, a deadly supernatural struggle begins. First published in 1903 as a successor to Dracula, this original version of the novel has never been reprinted before. This edition also includes the alternative ending for the 1912 revised edition.Abraham (Bram) Stoker was an Irish writer, best known for his Gothic classic Dracula, which continues to influence horror writers and fans more than 100 years after it was first published. Educated at Trinity College, Dublin, in science, mathematics, oratory, history, and composition, Stoker&#39; s writing was greatly influenced by his father&#39; s interest in theatre and his mother&#39; s gruesome stories about her childhood during the cholera epidemic in 1832. Although a published author of the novels Dracula, The Lady of the Shroud, and The Lair of the White Worm, and his work as part of the literary staff of The London Daily Telegraph, Stoker made his living as the personal assistant of actor Henry Irving and the business manager of the Lyceum Theatre in London. Stoker died in 1912, leaving behind one of the most memorable horror characters ever created.</p><h2>The Waning of the Renaissance, 1550-1640 (Yale Intellectual History of the West Se)</h2><p>Historians conventionally view intellectual and artistic achievement as a seamless progression in a single direction. William J. Bouwsma rethinks the accepted view, arguing that while the Renaissance had a beginning and a climax, it also had an ending.</p><p>Historians have conventionally viewed intellectual and artistic achievement as a seamless progression in a single direction, with the Renaissance, as identified by Jacob Burckhardt, as the root and foundation of modern culture. But in this brilliant new analysis William Bouwsma rethinks the accepted view, arguing that while the Renaissance had a beginning and, unquestionably, a climax, it also had an ending.Examining the careers of some of the greatest figures of the age-Montaigne, Galileo, Jonson, Descartes, Hooker, Shakespeare, and Cervantes among many others- Bouwsma perceives in their work a growing sense of doubt and anxiety about the modern world. He considers first those features of modern European culture generally associated with the traditional Renaissance, features which reached their climax in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. But even as the movements of the Renaissance gathered strength, simultaneous impulses operated in a contrary direction. Bouwsma identifies a growing concern with personal identity, shifts in the interests of major thinkers, a decline in confidence about the future, and a heightening of anxiety.Exploring the fluctuating and sometimes contradictory atmosphere in which Renaissance artists and thinkers operated, Bouwsma shows how the very liberation from old boundaries and modes of expression that characterized the Renaissance became itself increasingly stifling and destructive. By drawing attention to the waning of the Renaissance culture of freedom and creativity, Bouwsma offers a wholly new and intriguing interpretation of the place of the European Renaissance in modern culture.William J. Bouwsma was Sather Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty, John Calvin, and A Usable Past, among other books.</p><h2>War and Conflict in the Early Modern World: 1500 - 1700 (War and Conflict Through the Ages)</h2><p>In this latest addition to the <i>War &amp; Conflict Through the Ages</i> series, Brian Sandberg offers a truly global examination of the intersections between war, culture, and society in the early modern period.

They here present the principles of solution talk along with a collection of case material and clinical vignettes, including work with individuals, families, and organizations. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>Solution talk is a term Furman and Ahola use to refer to a constructive and agreeable manner of talking with people about problems. A conversation dominated by &#34;solution talk&#34; rather than &#34;problem talk&#34; is characterized by an atmosphere of mutual respect and is likely to focus on the future rather than the past, on resources rather than failings, on success and progress rather than failure, on credit rather than blame, and on solutions rather than problems. This book brings the principles of solution talk to life. Furman and Ahola demonstrate that in situations where there seems little or no reason to hope, where the burdens of the past seem too heavy to bear and the future looks dark, there are always some overlooked resources. They show that in uncovering resources one does not have to be serious--much can be accomplished by injecting a small dose of humor within the context of a large dose of respect. Furman and Ahola persuasively demonstrate how simply inviting people to generate visions of a positive future can open the way to new possibilities. They provocatively argue for a more constructive vocabulary to refer to problem behavior and stir the imagination of the reader by eschewing conventional psychological explanations in favor of inventive--even absurd--ones. If these principles were presented without clinical examples, readers might doubt the applicability of solution talk to difficult and seemingly intractable cases. But the authors have provided an impressive collection of case material and clinical vignettes, including work with individuals, families, and organizations. Told with candor, respect and humor, these stories refreshingly document the emerging view ofpsychotherapy not as a method of curing disturbed people and families, nor as a technique for fixing problems, but rather as a way of conversing with people that is likely to inspire solutions and enhance collaboration among those concerned. In Solution Talk Furman and Ahola manage to convince even the skeptics that the contemporary shift in emphasis from the &#34;negative&#34; to the &#34;positive&#34; is a desirable progression in the evolution of psychotherapy and the helping professions at large.</p><h2>The Cultures of Cities</h2><p>How do cities use culture today? Building on the experience of New York as a "culture capital" Sharon Zukin shows how three notions of culture - as ethnicity, aesthetic, and marketing tool - are reshaping urban places and conflicts over revitalization. She rejects the idea that cities have either a singular urban culture or many different subcultures to argue that cultures are constantly negotiated in the city's central spaces - the streets, parks, shops, museums, and restaurants - which are the great public spaces of modernity. <p>While cultural gentrification may contribute to making our cities both safer and more civilised places to live, it has its darker side. Beneath the perceptions of "civility" and "security" nurtured by cultural strategies, Zukin shows an aggressive private-sector bid for control of public space, a relentless drive for expansion by art museums and other non-profit cultural institutions, and an increasing redesign of the built environment for the purposes of social control.</p> <p>Tying these developments to a new "symbolic economy" based on tourism, media and entertainment, Zukin traces the connections between real estate development and popular expression, and between elite visions of the arts and more democratic representations. Going beyond the immigrants, artists, street peddlers, and security guards who are the key figures in the symbolic economy, Zukin asks: Who really occupies the central spaces of cities? And whose culture is imposed as public culture?</p> <p>Combining cultural critique, interviews, autobiography and ethnography, <i>The Culture of Cities</i> is a compelling account of the public spaces of modernity as they are transformed into new, more troubling landscapes.</p></p><p>When Lewis Mumford wrote his now-classic <i>The Culture of Cities</i> in 1934, it could safely be assumed that "culture" was an epiphenomenon that sprung organically from the activities of the people of a city. Zurkin builds upon Mumford's arguments for a late 20th-century reinterpretation, discussing the ways in which cities' cultures are increasingly the product of complex negotiations between ethnic groups, artistic and architectural elites, and multinational purveyors of canned culture. Her chapters dealing with the effects of Disneyland on urban planning, the creation of a "cultural center" in the rural Berkshires, and the nature of shopping in urban settings are particularly intriguing. Her primary concern is how economic elites gain the upper hand in representation as <i>the</i> culture of a city: in her view, culture is, increasingly, a consciously synthesized mirage optimized for economic gain.

The main symptom was a strange desire to run away from their masters. In earlier centuries gout was understood as a metabolic disease of the affluent, so much so that it became a badge of uppercrust honor&#x2015;and a medical excuse to avoid hard work. Today, is there such a thing as mental illness, or is mental illness just a myth? Is Alzheimer's really a disease? What is menopause&#x2015;a biological or a social construction?<br><br>Historically one can see that health, disease, and illness are concepts that have been ever fluid. Modern science, sociology, philosophy, even society&#x2015;among other factors&#x2015;constantly have these issues under microscopes, learning more, defining and redefining ever more exactly. Yet often that scrutiny, instead of leading toward hard answers, only leads to more questions.<i> Health, Disease, and Illness</i> brings together a sterling list of classic and contemporary thinkers to examine the history, state, and future of ever-changing "concepts" in medicine. <br><br>Divided into four parts&#x2015;Historical Discussions; Characterizing Health, Disease, and Illness; Clinical Applications of Health and Disease; and Normalcy, Genetic Disease, and Enhancement: The Future of the Concepts of Health and Disease&#x2015;the reader can see the evolutionary arc of medical concepts from the Greek physician Galen of Pergamum (ca. 150 ce) who proposed that "the best doctor is also a philosopher," to contemporary discussions of the genome and morality. The editors have recognized a crucial need for a deeper integration of medicine and philosophy with each other, particularly in an age of dynamically changing medical science&#x2015;and what it means, medically, philosophically, to be human.</p><p>"This welcome anthology, encompassing an admirably broad variety of perspectives, ancient and modern, on the fundamental categorical and moral questions embedded in definitions of human health and disorder, is sure to become an essential resource for all who think seriously about the theory and practice of medicine." --Margaret E. Mohrmann, M.D., Ph.D., Harrison Professor of Pediatrics, University of Virginia <p>"The articles in this collection present remarkably lucid, well-reasoned discussions of the issues at the junction of philosophy and medicine.

A very valuable collection that should be read by everyone involved in bioethics, the medical humanities and philosophy of medicine." --Richard M. Zaner, Ann Geddes Stahlman Professor Emeritus of Medical Ethics &amp; Philosophy of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and author of CONVERSATIONS ON THE EDGE: NARRATIVES OF ETHICS AND ILLNESS </p><p>"This is an important, provocative collection about health and disease. It is the most comprehensive collection of its kind, bringing together in one volume historical works by figures such as Maimonides, late 20th century philosophical works by figures such as Boorse, sociological essays about contemporary diagnoses such as the chronic fatigue syndrome, and recent essays exploring the impact of the new genetics on our conceptions of health and disease. It will make an excellent resource in the philosophy of medicine and wonderful reading for anyone interested in the relationship between the philosophy of medicine and medical ethics. I hope that its publication will spark a renewed interest in the philosophy of medicine among those who can see that this is the direction bioethics must take to meet the challenges of the 21st century." --Daniel P.

Somerset Maugham,<br>Virginia Woolf, H. G. Wells, Henry James, and J. B. Priestley<br><br>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Arnold Bennett's] superb Old Wives' Tale, wandering from person to person and from scene to scene, is by far the finest 'long novel' that has been written in English and in the English fashion, in this generation."<br>--H. G. Wells<br><br>First published in 1908, The Old Wives' Tale affirms the integrity of ordinary lives as it tells the story of the Baines sisters--shy, retiring Constance and defiant, romantic Sophia--over the course of nearly half a century. Bennett traces the sisters' lives from childhood in their father's drapery shop in provincial Bursley, England, during the mid-Victorian era, through their married lives, to the modern industrial age, when they are reunited as old women. The setting moves from the Five Towns of Staffordshire to exotic and cosmopolitan Paris, while the action moves from the subdued domestic routine of the Baines household to the siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War.<br>"Like Wordsworth, [Arnold Bennett] has triumphed over the habitual; he has not let it disguise the particle of beauty from him."--Rebecca West<br><br>ARNOLD BENNETT (1867-1931) looked to Flaubert, Maupassant, and Balzac for inspiration in the fashioning of his own acutely realistic novels, including his masterpiece, The Old Wives' Tale (1908). His first novel was A Man from the North (1898), and he is also known for his Clayhanger trilogy (1910-16).<br><br>The author of thirteen books of fiction, FRANCINE PROSE is a <br>fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities and the New York Public Library's Center for Scholars and Writers.</p><p>ARNOLD BENNETT was born in Staffordshire on May 27, 1867, the son of a solictor. Rather than following his father into the law, Bennett moved to London at the age of twenty-one and began a career in writing . His first novel, &#34;The Man from the North,&#34; was published in 1898 during a spell as editor of a periodical -- throughout his life journalism supplemented his writing career. In 1902 Bennett moved to Paris, married, and published some of his best known novels, most of which were set in The Potteries district where he grew up: &#34;Anna of the Five Towns &#34;(1902), &#34;The Old Wives Tale&#34; (1908), and the &#34;Clayhanger&#34; series (1910-1918). These works, as well as several successful plays, established him both in Europe and America as one of the most popular and acclaimed writers of his era. Bennett returned to England in 1912, and during the First World War worked for Lord Beaverbrook in the Ministry of Information. In 1921, separated from his first wife, he fell in love with an actress, Dorothy Cheston, with whom he had a child. He received the James Tait Black Award for his novel &#34;Riceyman Steps&#34; in 1923. Arnold Bennett died of typhoid in London on March 27, 1931.Those two girls, Constance and Sophia Baines, paid no heed to the manifold interest of their situation, of which, indeed, they had never been conscious. <br><br>They were, for example, established almost precisely on the fifty-third parallel of latitude. A little way to the north of them, in the creases of a hill famous for its religious orgies, rose the river Trent, the calm and characteristic stream of middle England. Somewhat farther northwards, in the near neighbourhood of the highest public-house in the realm, rose two lesser rivers, the Dane and the Dove, which, quarrelling in early infancy, turned their back on each other, and, the one by favour of the Weaver and the other by favour of the Trent, watered between them the whole width of England, and poured themselves respectively into the Irish Sea and the German Ocean. What a county of modest, unnoticed rivers! What a natural, simple county, content to fix its boundaries by these tortuous island brooks, with their comfortable names--Trent, Mease, Dove, Tern, Dane, Mees, Stour, Tame, and even hasty Severn! Not that the Severn is suitable to the county! In the county excess is deprecated. The county is happy in not exciting remark. It is content that Shropshire should possess that swollen bump, the Wrekin, and that the exaggerated wildness of the Peak should lie over its border. It does not desire to be a pancake, like Cheshire. It has everything that England has, including thirty miles of Watling Street; and England can show nothing more beautiful and nothing uglier than the works of nature and the works of man to be seen within the limits of the county. It is England in little, lost in the midst of England, unsung by searchers after the extreme; perhaps occasionally somewhat sore at this neglect, but how proud in the instinctive cognizance of its representative features and traits!<br><br>Constance and Sophia, busy with the intense preoccupations of youth, recked not of such matters. They were surrounded by the county. On every side the fields and moors of Staffordshire, intersected by roads and lanes, railways, watercourses and telegraph-lines, patterned by hedges, ornamented and made respectable by halls and genteel parks, enlivened by villages at the intersections, and warmly surveyed by the sun, spread out undulating. And trains were rushing round curves in deep cuttings, and carts and waggons trotting and jingling on the yellow roads, and long, narrow boats passing in a leisure majestic and infinite over the surface of the stolid canals; the rivers had only themselves to support, for Staffordshire rivers have remained virgin of keels to this day. One could imagine the messages concerning prices, sudden death, and horses, in their flight through the wires under the feet of birds. In the inns Utopians were shouting the universe into order over beer, and in the halls and parks the dignity of England was being preserved in a fitting manner. The villages were full of women who did nothing but fight against dirt and hunger, and repair the effects of friction on clothes. Thousands of labourers were in the fields, but the fields were so broad and numerous that this scattered multitude was totally lost therein. The cuckoo was much more perceptible than man, dominating whole square miles with his resounding call. And on the airy moors heath-larks played in the ineffaceable muletracks that had served centuries before even the Romans thought of Watling Street. In short, the usual daily life of the county was proceeding with all its immense variety and importance; but though Constance and Sophia were in it they were not of it.<br><br>The fact is, that while in the county they were also in the district; and no person who lives in the district, even if he should be old and have nothing to do but reflect upon things in general, ever thinks about the county. So far as the county goes, the district might almost as well be in the middle of the Sahara. It ignores the county, save that it uses it nonchalantly sometimes as leg-stretcher on holiday afternoons, as a man may use his back garden. It has nothing in common with the county; it is richly sufficient to itself. <br><br>Nevertheless, its self-sufficiency and the true salt savour of its life can only be appreciated by picturing it hemmed in by county. It lies on the face of the county like an insignificant stain, like a dark Pleiades in a green and empty sky. And Hanbridge has the shape of a horse and its rider, Bursley of half a donkey, Knype of a pair of trousers, Longshaw of an octopus, and little Turnhill of a beetle. The Five Towns seem to cling together for safety. Yet the idea of clinging together for safety would make them laugh. They are unique and indispensable. From the north of the county right down to the south they alone stand for civilization, applied science, organized manufacture, and the century--until you come to Wolverhampton. They are unique and indispensable because you cannot drink tea out of a teacup without the aid of the Five Towns; because you cannot eat a meal in decency without the aid of the Five Towns. For this the architecture of the Five Towns is an architecture of ovens and chimneys; for this its atmosphere is as black as its mud; for this it burns and smokes all night, so that Longshaw has been compared to hell; for this it is unlearned in the ways of agriculture, never having seen corn except as packing straw and in quartern loaves; for this, on the other hand, it comprehends the mysterious habits of fire and pure, sterile earth; for this it lives crammed together in slippery streets where the housewife must change white window-curtains at least once a fortnight if she wishes to remain respectable; for this it gets up in the mass at six a.m., winter and summer, and goes to bed when the public-houses close; for this it exists--that you may drink tea out of a teacup and toy with a chop on a plate. All the everyday crockery used in the kingdom is made in the Five Towns--all, and much besides. A district capable of such gigantic manufacture, of such a perfect monopoly--and which finds energy also to produce coal and iron and great men--may be an insignificant stain on a county, considered geographically, but it is surely well justified in treating the county as its back garden once a week, and in blindly ignoring it the rest of the time.<br>Even the majestic thought that whenever and wherever in all England a woman washes up, she washes up the product of the district; that whenever and wherever in all England a plate is broken the fracture means new business for the district--even this majestic thought had probably never occurred to either of the girls. The fact is, that while in the Five Towns they were also in the Square. <br><br>Bursley and the Square ignored the staple manufacture as perfectly as the district ignored the county. Bursley has the honours of antiquity in the Five Towns. No industrial development can ever rob it of its superiority in age, which makes it absolutely sure in its conceit. And the time will never come when the other towns--let them swell and bluster as they may--will not pronounce the name of Bursley as one pronounces the name of one's mother. Add to this that the Square was the centre of Bursley's retail trade (which scorned the staple as something wholesale, vulgar, and assuredly filthy), and you will comprehend the importance and the self-isolation of the Square in the scheme of the created universe. There you have it, embedded in the district, and the district embedded in the county, and the county lost and dreaming in the heart of England!<br><br>The Square was named after St Luke. The Evangelist might have been startled by certain phenomena in his square, but, except in Wakes Week, when the shocking always happened, St Luke's Square lived in a manner passably saintly--though it contained five public-houses. It contained five public-houses, a bank, a barber's, a confectioner's, three grocers', two chemists', an ironmonger's, a clothier's, and five drapers'. These were all the catalogue. St Luke's Square had no room for minor establishments. The aristocracy of the Square undoubtedly consisted of the drapers (for the bank was impersonal); and among the five the shop of Baines stood supreme. No business establishment could possibly be more respected than that of Mr Baines was respected. And though John Baines had been bedridden for a dozen years, he still lived on the lips of admiring, ceremonious burgesses as "our honoured fellow-townsman." He deserved his reputation.<br><br>The Baineses' shop, to make which three dwellings had at intervals been thrown into one, lay at the bottom of the Square. It formed about one-third of the south side of the Square, the remainder being made up of Critchlow's (chemist), the clothier's, and the Hanover Spirit Vaults. ("Vaults" was a favourite synonym of the public-house in the Square. Only two of the public-houses were crude public-houses: the rest were "vaults.") It was a composite building of three storeys, in blackish-crimson brick, with a projecting shop-front, and, above and behind that, two rows of little windows. On the sash of each window was a red cloth roll stuffed with sawdust, to prevent draughts; plain white blinds descended about six inches from the top of each window. There were no curtains to any of the windows save one; this was the window of the drawing-room, on the first floor at the corner of the Square and King Street. Another window, on the second storey, was peculiar, in that it had neither blind nor pad, and was very dirty; this was the window of an unused room that had a separate staircase to itself, the staircase being barred by a door always locked. Constance and Sophia had lived in continual expectation of the abnormal issuing from that mysterious room, which was next to their own. But they were disappointed. The room had no shameful secret except the incompetence of the architect who had made one house out of three; it was just an empty, unemployable room. The building had also a considerable frontage on King Street, where, behind the shop, was sheltered the parlour, with a large wi...</p><h2>The Empirical Stance (The Terry Lectures Series)</h2><p>What is empiricism and what could it be? Bas C. van Fraassen, one of the world&#x2019;s foremost contributors to philosophical logic and the philosophy of science, here undertakes a fresh consideration of these questions and offers a program for renewal of the empiricist tradition. The empiricist tradition is not and could not be defined by common doctrines, but embodies a certain stance in philosophy, van Fraassen says. This stance is displayed first of all in a searing, recurrent critique of metaphysics, and second in a focus on experience that requires a voluntarist view of belief and opinion. Van Fraassen focuses on the philosophical problems of scientific and conceptual revolutions and on the not unrelated ruptures between religious and secular ways of seeing or conceiving of ourselves. He explores what it is to be or not be secular and points the way toward a new relationship between secularism and science within philosophy.</p><p>The Terry Lectures Series&#34;Van Fraassen, the most influential empiricist of recent decades, combines a penetrating discussion of empiricism in science and philosophy with a sympathetic discussion of religion. . . . [An] eloquent examination of empiricism and religion.&#34;--Paul Thagard, Science; &#34;An ambitious, absorbing, iconoclastic, metaphilosophical treatise.&#34;-Richard Rorty, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews; &#34;This work argues powerfully for a radical redirection of much contemporary thinking in epistemology and other important topics.

Retold in verse and accompanied by Caroline Pedler&#39;s evocative illustrations, this is a story to provoke thought about the meaning of Christmas and leave the reader with a warm Christmas glow.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>Manual of Emergency Airway Management</h2><p><b>Manual of Emergency Airway Management</b>, now in its 4th edition, is a practical guide to emergency airway management in any adult or pediatric patient and offers step-by-step instructions on techniques, drug administration, and prevention and management of complications.The book may be used in conjunction with the Difficult Airway CourseTM, or on its own.

He was a Soviet chess grandmaster and author. One of the strongest players in the world, he set the record for the best score in an Interzonal Tournament for the World Chess Championship, a record Bobby Fischer tried to beat without success. He was a Soviet champion, a two-time world title Candidate, and a prolific chess author. Kotov served in high posts in the Soviet Chess Federation and most of his books were written during the period of Cold War between the US and the USSR. Kotov&#39;s books also included frequent praise for the Soviet system in general. The 1958 book The Soviet School of Chess (which he co-wrote with Mikhail Yudovich) stated that &#34;The rise of the Soviet school to the summit of world chess is a logical result of socialist cultural development.&#34; Notwithstanding Kotov&#39;s forays into the political realm, his books were insightful and informative and were written in a congenial style. He often made his points by citing first-hand stories of incidents involving famous grandmasters, most of whom he knew personally. Such entertaining and enlightening personal accounts helped to ensure that his books would remain popular among chess players of widely varying nationalities and playing strengths. He died on 8 January 1981.</p><h2>Give Me Liberty!

World-renowned Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama has worked in a variety of media, including painting, sculpture, performance art, and installation. Kusama&#x2019;s iconic <i>Infinity Mirror Rooms</i>, which originated with <i>Phalli&#x2019;s Field</i> in 1965, situate viewers in kaleidoscopic spaces filled with multicolored lights or whimsical forms. These mirror-lined installations reflect endlessly, distorting rooms to project the illusion of infinite space. Over the years, the works have come to symbolize different modalities within the various contexts they have inhabited, from Kusama's &#x201c;self-obliteration&#x201d; in the Vietnam War era to her more harmonious aspirations in the present. By examining her early unsettling installations alongside her more recent ethereal atmospheres, this volume aims to historicize the body of work amidst the resurgence of experiential practices within the global landscape of contemporary art. Generously illustrated, this publication invites readers to examine the series&#x2019; impact over the course of the artist&#x2019;s career.

When it was <br>published in 1847, it was a great popular success. The power of the writing, the masterly <br>handling of the narrative, and the boldly realistic style were much admired. But many found it difficult to believe that Currer Bell, the pseudonymous author, was Charlotte Bront�, a young woman from a bleak Yorkshire parsonage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time has served Jane Eyre well. Charlotte Bront�'s social commentary still fascinates; the novel is still powerful, full of erotic tension, passion, and irony. It can be read as an astonishing paradigm of feminist writing. At its heart is the assertion that a woman has the right to be independent, and its insistence on that fact and on the equality of the sexes makes it a truly revolutionary work of art. Above all, Jane Eyre is a marvelous love story, as affecting as any in fiction. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Diane Johnson has provided a new Introduction to this Modern Library edition, which is the companion volume to the A&amp;E television presentation. The Modern Library also publishes Charlotte Bront�'s three other completed novels: The Professor, Shirley, and Villette.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p><br>The Modern Library of the World's<br>Best Books<br><br>"So we open Jane Eyre....The writer has us<br>by the hand, forces us along her road, makes<br>us see what she sees, never leaves us for a<br>moment or allows us to forget her.

That same day locals find a dog, nearly dead and tethered to an empty skiff. Odd yet seemingly trivial, the arrival of a masterless dog and a returned letter triggers a series of events that will dramatically change the lives of three friends and affect all of the residents of Bayou Chene.<br>Gwen Roland's debut novel, set in 1907 in a secluded part of Louisiana, follows young adults Loyce Snellgrove, her cousin Lafayette "Fate" Landry, and his friend Valzine Broussard as they navigate between revelations about the past and tensions in the present. Forces large and small -- the tragedies of the Civil War, the hardships of swamp life, family secrets, as well as unfailing humor -- create a prismatic depiction of Louisiana folklife at the turn of the twentieth century and provide a realistic setting for this enchanting drama.<br>Roland anchors her work in historical fact and weaves a superb tale of vivid characters. In Postmark Bayou Chene, she uses the captivating voice that described the beauty and challenges of the swamp to legions of readers in her autobiographical Atchafalaya Houseboat. Her ear for dialogue and eye for detail bring the now-vanished community of Bayou Chene and the realities of love and loss on the river back to life in a well-crafted, bittersweet tribute.</p></p><p><p>Gwen Roland is the author of Atchafalaya Houseboat: My Years in the Louisiana Swamp, published by LSU Press.

Utilitarianism today faces challenges on several fronts: it cannot warrant the drawing of adequate protective boundaries around the essential interests of individuals, and it does not allow them the space to pursue the personal concerns which give meaning to their lives. Geoffrey Scarre considers these and other charges, and concludes that whilst utilitarianism may not be a faultless moral doctrine, its positions are relevant, and significant today.<br> Written with undergraduates in mind, this is an ideal course book for those studying and those teaching moral philosophy.</p><p>"Scarre [offers an] interesting and sympathetic treatment of the utilitarian tradition. [He] also introduces readers to key problems still being debated by utilitarians and their critics in the philosophical literature."<br>-Jonathan Riley, Tulane University <br></p><h2>The Parent&#39;s Guide to College for Students on the Autism Spectrum</h2><p>Sending a son or daughter off to college is daunting and fear-provoking experience for most parents, but if your child has an autism spectrum disorder, the challenge is magnified many times over.

These skills should be taught long before the child goes to college. They are part of growing up and necessary for succeeding in college. Still, the biggest obstacle for most autistic students is learning to do well in social situations. For example, I had to learn that it was O.K. to cry if I was frustrated on the job rather than lashing out physically. A high-tech company will not fire you for crying, but they will if you throw things or hit others.

Goffen offers a new interpretation of the artist's paintings of women in the context of life in 16th-century Venice. Without denying the erotic appeal of Titian's women, Goffen goes beyond sexual suggestion to show the larger themes that women symbolized for the artist. 60 color and 117 b&amp;w illustrations .</p><p>Just as the Italian peninsula itself was a patchwork of widely divergent city-states up until the 19th-century <i>risorgimento</i>, so the art and artists of the Italian Renaissance differed according to the regions in which they flourished. If Florence is the city most often associated with Renaissance art, Venice runs a close second; and of all the artists associated with the Venetian style, Titian is arguably the greatest. In <i>Titian's Women</i>, art historian Rona Goffen examines the role of women in the great man's work. Whether painting a bride or a goddess, Titian brought a degree of respect and empathy to his portraits; though his models may have been prostitutes, Goffen argues, the finished subjects were indisputably ladies. Combining art history with a remarkable command of the period's social history, Goffen crafts a fascinating discussion of Titian's work, his times, and his particular genius.</p><h2>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales (Oxford Books of Prose &amp; Verse)</h2><p>Brimming with tales of terror, suspense, and the uncanny, this work offers a collection devoted to the best of the Gothic genre. Each story contains the common elements of the gothic talea warped sense of time, a claustrophobic setting, a link to archaic modes of thought, and the impression of a descent into disintegration. Yet taken together, they reveal the progression of the genre from stories of feudal villains amid crumbling ruins to a greater level of sophistication in which writers brought the gothic tale out of its medieval setting, and placed it in the contemporary world. Bringing together the work of such writers as Eudora Welty, Thomas Hardy, Edgar Allan Poe, William Faulkner, Arthur Conan Doyle, Joyce Carol Oates, and Jorge Luis Borges, <em>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales</em> presents a wide array of the sinister and unsettling for all lovers of ghost stories, fantasy, and horror.<br></p><p>Chris Baldick, Goldsmiths&#39; College, University of London.The fog-enshrouded castle, the crumbling family manor; old secrets unveiled, curses cast, chains clanking, fear and trembling; dread, decay, disintegration, death--each of these trademarks of the well-made Gothic tale is vividly represented in this comprehensive anthology. Informatively introduced and chronologically arranged, the 37 stories showcase the Gothic tradition from its late-18th-century inception up to the present. Included are genre classics from such illustrious practitioners as Poe, Hawthorne, Lovecraft and McGrath, as well as gems from literary masters like Faulkner, Welty, Oates and Borges, all of whom dabble(d) to fine effect in the form. Among the highlights are "The Parricide Punished," an anonymous entry from 1799 set in an enormous castle and narrated by a guest whose visit becomes a waking nightmare; Eden Glasgow's "Jordan's End," in which a long history of family madness gives rise to a most untimely death; F. M. Mayor's "Miss DeMannering of Asham," the story of two women on holiday who get more local color than they bargained for when they learn the shocking truth about DeMannering's dead infant; and especially Ray Russell's bizarre "Sardonicus," whose title character gives the kind of villainous performance that evokes Vincent Price in his horror-movie heyday. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Signals and Systems</h2><p><p><b>Confusing Textbooks?</b></p> <p><b>Missed Lectures? </b></p> <p><b>Tough Test Questions? </b></p> <p>Fortunately for you, there's Schaum's Outlines.

We talk about putting our hearts into our work and wearing our hearts on our sleeves. There are people who are warmhearted and those willing to heal your heartache. Each of us has likely known the pangs of conflict between the head and heart. For all the trials and pains of daily living, many people are taught to distance themselves from their hearts in order to avoid folly and failure. The truth is that only in embracing the language of the heart can we truly know who we are and where we are going. <br><br>Focusing on the role of crystals in the journey to wholeheartedness, Nicholas Pearson reveals how the heart, as the literal and metaphorical center of one&#x2019;s being, has the power to lead us to greater balance, healing, and happiness. He explores the anatomy of the physical heart and its spiritual symbolism and shows how its four chambers are related to the four elements. Offering hands-on exercises and meditations with more than 60 gemstones and minerals, each a specific heart-healing stone, the author explains how to build a better relationship with the heart as your spiritual center as well as how to fortify your heart with emotional strength, reclaim your will, and cultivate forgiveness. He shows how your heart is the coordinator of your energy field and is itself a sensory organ and information processor, working to enact healing on many levels. He also looks at the heart chakra and how the higher heart chakra is evolving. <br><br>Providing stone-supported lessons for applying a heart-centered approach in daily life, from expressing yourself to nurturing romantic relationships in a meaningful way, the author shows how the journey to wholeness and wholeheartedness isn&#x2019;t always easy, but it cannot be undertaken without first spending time to hear the soft, gentle voice of your heart and embrace the transformational force of inner alchemy known as love.</p><p>Nicholas Pearson has been immersed in all aspects of the mineral kingdom for more than 20 years.

TRIZ is the Russian acronym for Theory of Inventive Problem Solving. TRIZ is a set of tools for directing creative thinking based upon the study of patents. Breakthrough thinking is not left to creative inspiration. Instead, new and innovative ideas that solve simple to highly complex technical problems or create new inventions can be systematically derived. TRIZICS is an organized process for the practical application of TRIZ, it incorporates TRIZ tools into a simple step-by-step framework that includes the logic of structured problem solving, leverages TRIZ tools for root cause analysis, and directs the user to select the appropriate TRIZ tool to use during the problem solving process. TRIZICS Reviews "It is probably one of the 5 books that in the field of engineering I consider a milestone." Salvatore Nasisi. &#x201c;As an innovation professional, I have headed R&amp;D departments, produced patents, and invented my share of stuff, but Cameron's book --a comprehensive guide to invention and problem solution-- is the best I have ever seen, bar none... TRIZICS is the new quintessential resource for creative problem solving and invention.&#x201d; Joe Colannino - Chief Technical Officer (CTO) &#x201c;...the most lucid and informative book on TRIZ I have read. Most importantly it clarifies when and when not to use the TRIZ methods in a way that is clear and obvious... Congratulations on producing a guide that anyone can follow with a bit of effort to scale the TRIZ Everest to Base Camp in a week and all the way to the summit with the assurance of having a Sherpa guide...&#x201d; Mike McMenamin - Master of Science in Lean Operations &#x201c;Gordon Cameron has written an excellent comprehensive treatment of TRIZ. The book covers the spectrum of the TRIZ tools starting with the basics of solving contradictions to more sophisticated tools such as substance field analysis and ARIZ. I would recommend reading this book to those just learning the subject as well as more advanced users.&#x201d; - Steven Ungvari, Lean Six Sigma Master, Graftech International. &#x201c;This book is brain food of the highest level and should be considered the sole truly applicable problem solving method using TRIZ. Sorry other TRIZ authors, but you lose....I delayed bothering with TRIZ many times in the past because no one could really explain it. So, if you want to learn TRIZ or want to learn new ways to think about it, you'll get what you're looking for right here...TRIZICS is an extremely comprehensive problem solving method that makes complicated things possible...I recommend you buy and use this book. The information is great and the design of that information is great also, which seems lost on anyone else who tries to explain this stuff. TRIZICS is the only book you'll ever need on TRIZ, so get it already!&#x201d; -Dan Bergevin, the Behance network &#x201c;A great presentation of TRIZ in an easy-to-understand format. I have recommended your book... Great job!&#x201d; -Terry Burton, President and Chief Executive Officer - The Center for Excellence in Operations, Inc. (CEO) &#x201c;Great book, extremely comprehensive. No one else has produced a book this in depth across such a large body of knowledge in the domain of TRIZ...it does justice to many areas of TRIZ that just aren't covered in the depth I have found elsewhere...I can't recommend this book highly enough to instructors, teachers, students, whether they be a beginner or advanced.&#x201d; Richard Platt Managing Partner - Principal - The Strategy + Innovation Group LLC &#x201c;This book was a revelation - it made the subject straightforward, logical and readable.

On all sides, and sometimes even under the road or footpath itself, there are fragments of the ancient past alongside the clutter of the modern world. Medieval villages, castles, ancient churches, and Roman villas are commonplace and take us back to the time of Christ. And far older, yet equally abundant, are the barrows, hillforts, stone circles, camps, standing stones, trackways, and other relics of prehistoric times.<br> Now, thanks to these three archaeologists--each a specialist in one of the three periods covered by the <em>Guide</em>: prehistoric, Roman, and medieval--readers have the chance to not only explore but to understand in context these fascinating sites and ruins. In addition to reporting on such well-known sites as Stonehenge and Hadrian's Wall, and cities such as London and York--which themselves offer a wealth of archaeological remains--the book also covers smaller, lesser-known sites throughout the country. An introductory section provides background to the monuments, and a reference section provides definitions, further reading, and information about museum collections.

His parents, ardent Polish patriots, died when he was a child, following their exile for anti-Russian activities, and he came under the protection of his tradition-conscious uncle, Thaddeus Bobrowski, who watched over him for the next twenty-five years. In 1874 Bobrowski conceded to his nephew's passionate desire to go to sea, and Conrad travelled to Marseilles, where he served in French merchant vessels before joining a British ship in 1878 as an apprentice. In 1886 he obtained British nationality and his Master's certificate in the British Merchant Service. Eight years later he left the sea to devote himself to writing, publishing his first novel, <b>Almayer's Folly</b>, in 1895. The following year he married Jessie George and eventually settled in Kent, where he produced within fifteen years such modern classics as <b>Youth</b>, <b>Heart of Darkness</b>, <b>Lord Jim</b>, <b>Typhoon</b>, <b>Nostromo</b>, <b>The Secret Agent</b> and <b>Under Western Eyes</b>.

Atget's work was rescued from obscurity by the photographer Berenice Abbot, who purchased much of it after Atget's death and published it. In a learned and perceptive text that is readable and well documented, Nesbit analyzes the source of Atget's images as "commercial picture documents" produced for paying customers: builders and designers, artists, and antiquarians. The seven albums, reproduced here in their entirety for the first time, document Paris subjects, from decorative architectural details and home interiors to views of city streets and the outskirts of Paris. Extensive appendixes further document Atget's work, and the bibliography gathers relevant sources on late 19th- and 20th-century French culture.

Plan complicated by additions made to original building by Jefferson after his return from France. Much fine interior woodwork.</i> </p><p> Historic American Buildings Survey For Monticello, November 2, 1940 </p><p> Thomas Jefferson, the original American Renaissance man, began clearing the land atop a small mountaintop to build the house of his dreams in 1768. He was twenty-five years old. The heavily wooded land three miles outside of Charlottesville in Albemarle County, Virginia, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains was part of the thousands of acres of land he had inherited in 1764 from his father, Peter Jefferson, a self-made cartographer, surveyor, landowner, and prominent citizen of Albemarle who married into one of the most powerful colonial American families, the Randolphs of Virginia. </p><p> Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, at Shadwell, his father's Albemarle County plantation. Since childhood Jefferson had dreamed of building a house on top of a nearby 560-foot mountain -- a radical idea at a time when most Virginia plantation homes were built in the low-lying, tobacco-growing Tidewater region. The name he selected for the site was "Monticello," Italian for hillock or small mountain. Jefferson designed the building based on his study of ancient -- particularly Roman -- architecture, and on the ideas of the great Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio (1508-1580). </p><p> Construction of Monticello began in 1769. A team of masons, carpenters, and joiners did the work. Some were white; others were Jefferson's slaves (he referred to them as "servants") who lived on the site along what became known as Mulberry Row. Jefferson himself moved to the small mountain in 1770 after Shadwell burned to the ground in a fire. </p><p> Some of the bricks and nails the workers used were forged on the mountaintop. The wood and stone used for the cellars and the columns on the East front and the limestone to make mortar came from Jefferson's own extensive estates. The window glass was imported from Europe. </p><p> Jefferson spent many years fine tuning the design for the house. In 1796 he tore up his original plans, and created new ones incorporating architectural ideas he was exposed to during the four years (1784-1789) he spent in Paris, first as American trade commissioner, and later as Minister to the Court of Louis XVI. By 1809, at the end of his second term as president when he came home from Washington to live full time at Monticello, the mansion was essentially complete. </p><p> The result was a 10,660-square-foot, twenty-room Roman neoclassical building with distinctly Jeffersonian touches. "The influence was Palladian, the immediate example was French, but viewed from any possible position Monticello was Jeffersonian," said longtime Monticello curator James A. Bear, Jr. Jefferson shaped every aspect of the house, inside and out, from the window draperies to the Windsor chairs. Jefferson packed the place with an impressive art collection, a library of books that grew to nearly seven thousand volumes in seven languages, and an enormous amount of household objects and fittings. </p><p> Most of the interior furnishings came from France in a shipment of 86 crates of furniture, silverware, glassware, china, wall paper, fabrics, books, portraits and other works of art, and household goods. As Monticello's curator Susan Stein says, during his years in France, Jefferson "shopped for a lifetime." </p><p> Included in this shipment of treasures were sixty-three paintings by different artists and seven terra-cotta plaster busts by the foremost French sculptor of the day, Jean-Antoine Houdon. Jefferson's European treasure trove also contained four dozen chairs, two sofas, six mirrors, assorted tables, four marble tabletops, and four full-length mirrors. Jefferson added more to this auspicious collection -- including eighteen chairs, six mirrors, several beds and tables -- from the top craftsmen in Williamsburg, New York, Philadelphia, and London. </p><p> Jefferson crammed Monticello's rooms with artwork, sculpture, archeological specimens, musical and scientific instruments, Indian artifacts, and <i>objets d'art</i> of all kinds. He designed features found in few homes in eighteenth-century America: two-story high ceilings, a dome -- the first on an American house -- beds tucked in alcoves, skylights, indoor "privies," extremely narrow staircases. Other one-of-a-kind interior touches included a dumbwaiter to carry wine from the cellar to the dining room and the enormous seven-day great clock framing the door of the entrance hall. </p><p> Jefferson -- the nation's third president and the man who wrote the Declaration of Independence -- was described by the Marquis de Chastellux in 1782 as a "Musician, Draftsman, Surveyor, Astronomer, Natural Philosopher, Jurist and Statesman." Jefferson was that and much more. </p><p> He also studied botany, agriculture, forestry, viticulture, and landscape architecture. Monticello's grounds -- which have been likened to an "ornamental working farm" -- were extremely well planned. Jefferson turned the wild hardwood forest on the mountaintop into a park with broad lawns and flowerbeds, and carved out an ornamental forest he called the Grove. He divided the surrounding three hundred acres into seven fields, each of which he planted in a different crop, rotating the crops annually. They were pleasingly and practically separated with rows of peach trees, numbering in the hundreds. </p><p> He selected many more fruit and shade trees, shrubs, and other plants at Main's nursery near Washington and personally laid out the flower beds surrounding the house. He imported seeds from Italy, from the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and from the top nurseries in Virginia, Philadelphia, Washington, and South Carolina. He planted dozens of varieties of fruit trees, including peaches, apples, cherries, apricots, nectarines, quinces, plums, and pears. He cultivated Seville orange trees, which he brought indoors during the winter, and imported olive trees from Italy and southern France. </p><p> Jefferson built a thousand-foot-long, three-terraced "kitchen" vegetable garden, with twenty-four beds divided into "Fruits, Roots, and Leaves." There he grew some 250 varieties of vegetables, including beans and corn from seeds brought to him by Lewis and Clark, seventeen kinds of peas, white eggplant, and purple broccoli. </p><p> Monticello was "an artistic achievement of the first order," in the words of Jefferson scholar Merrill D. Peterson, but it was a seriously flawed achievement. All was not well when the nation's third president came to live at Monticello full time on March 15, 1809. The debts he had accumulated before becoming president in 1801 still weighed heavily. While Jefferson had managed to pay off many of his pre-Revolutionary debts to British firms out of his not-insignificant $25,000 annual presidential salary, the interest that had accumulated on the remaining debts was crippling. </p><p> Jefferson owed his creditors about $11,000 when he bid farewell to Washington, D.C., and headed home. That amount was not troubling to him, even though there was no presidential pension plan. Jefferson believed that he could easily repay what he owed from the income he would earn from his farming operations at Monticello and his other Virginia properties, which included the nearby farms of Shadwell, Tufton, and Lego in Albemarle County and Poplar Forest in Bedford County. </p><p> There was reason to be optimistic. Jefferson owned a total of some 10,000 acres, about half of it in Albemarle County and the remainder in nearby Bedford County, including his country retreat at the Poplar Forest plantation. He also owned the 157-acre Natural Bridge to the west in Rockbridge County in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley. Jefferson had bought that scenic property from King George III for twenty shillings in 1774. The plan was to earn money from travelers who came there to see the spectacular natural rock bridge formation. Jefferson took the first step in that direction in 1803 by building a two-room log cabin on the site. He also owned several building lots, including one in Richmond. He expected to reap further dividends from the two gristmills he owned on the Rivanna River, which he expected to produce more than a thousand dollars in income a year. </p><p> But Jefferson's financial problems worsened after he moved to Monticello. His farming operations rarely did anything but lose money due to periodic droughts, crop failures, and depressed crop prices. The mills were poorly managed and their hoped-for revenues never materialized. Jefferson's debts mounted, augmented by growing sums he owed to Charlottesville-area merchants from whom he bought everything from tea and coffee for his household to salt fish and "Negro cloth" for the more than two hundred slaves he owned. </p><p> He was also burdened financially by his generous hospitality and family responsibilities. Jefferson's wife Martha had died in 1782, but his adult children, his grandchildren, his sisters and their children, and various other relatives and friends spent long periods of time in residence at Monticello, especially after 1815. By all accounts, Jefferson was hospitable to other visitors as well, some who venerated the man, and others who sought him out for favors. They included artists and writers, traveling merchants, would-be biographers, adventurers, and the just plain curious. The list included noted figures such as Daniel Webster, the Marquis de Lafayette, James Madison, and Jefferson's Albemarle County neighbor, James Monroe. The well-heeled came with horses, servants, and family members. Sometimes he found himself hosting as many as fifty guests at a time. </p><p> The domestic manager of the sprawling household during Jefferson's post-presidency retirement was his eldest daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, whom Jefferson called "Patsy." Martha had joined the household in 1809, with her children and her husband, Col. Thomas Mann Randolph -- a notoriously inept businessman who was constantly in financial straits. There she continued her role as hostess and female household head that she had begun in Washington. </p><p> Jefferson's financial situation deteriorated further after the War of 1812. His expenses continued to outstrip his income and he was forced to take on additional loans, while continuing to make interest payments. In 1815, his farming operations were particularly hard hit by a severe drought. That spring, Jefferson turned the management of his Albemarle County farms over to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, his eldest and favorite grandson. By all accounts Jeff Randolph was trustworthy and extremely competent in business matters, especially compared to his dissolute father. </p><p> But even with the good management of his grandson, Jefferson's financial woes continued. He experienced some relief in 1815 when Congress, after a spirited debate and by a small majority, agreed to buy his library of 6,487 books for $23,950. Jefferson had offered the books -- the largest personal collection in the country -- to the nation in September soon after he learned that British troops had burned the congressional library in Washington a month earlier. Because of his generous offer to expand the library, Jefferson has been known as the father of the Library of Congress, which had started in 1800 and had consisted of some three thousand volumes before the disastrous fire. A Library of Congress exhibit on Jefferson in 2000 included a re-creation of the library Jefferson sold to the nation in 1815. It filled twenty twelve-foot-high bookcases. </p><p> This large congressional cash infusion did little to stem Jefferson's fiscal woes. He continued to lay out lavish sums to maintain his large household. With his farms and mills providing little or no relief Jefferson was forced to borrow further and his debts mounted. </p><p> In January 1826, five months before his death, the eighty-two-year-old Jefferson came up with a plan that he believed would pay off all his debts: a state lottery. In part, the lottery idea was a reaction to his failed effort to sell off large parcels of land at a time when land prices were severely depressed. When he proposed the idea to the Virginia legislature in Richmond, Jefferson received a lukewarm reception, although several legislators floated a plan to provide him an $80,000 interest-free loan. </p><p> After the Virginia legislature's debate over the lottery made the newspapers, Jefferson's financial plight became known throughout the country. He received many letters of support, including one from James Monroe (1758-1831), the nation's fifth president who owned a large amount of land in the state and was in similar land-rich, cash-poor financial difficulties. </p><p> The publicity over Jefferson's misfortunes resulted in several unsolicited contributions, including a bank note for $7,500 from a group of admirers in New York. </p><p> But Jefferson pinned his hopes on the lottery. He let it be known that if the lottery did not work, he was prepared to sell Monticello and his mills and move to his property in Bedford County. As he put it in a February 17 letter to Madison: "If refused, I must sell everything here, perhaps considerably in Bedford, move thither with my family, where I have not even a log hut to put my head into." </p><p> A lottery bill was passed by the Virginia legislature on February 20, one in which Monticello essentially was the prize. The plan was to sell at least 11,000 lottery tickets at ten dollars each. Under the plan, Jefferson would keep Monticello for the rest of his life, but it would go to the lottery winner after his death. His daughter Martha, the head of the family, was reconciled to losing Monticello after the lottery law was passed. </p><p> When Jefferson died on July 4, 1826, no lottery tickets had yet been sold. </p><p> ... </p><p> At his death Jefferson owed his creditors $107,273.63. The largest amount by far was the $60,110 he owed to his grandson and executor of his estate, Jeff Randolph. Twenty thousand dollars of that amount represented a note Jefferson had co-signed for Jeff's late father-in-law, Wilson Cary Nicholas, and the balance was made up of expenses that Jeff Randolph paid while managing his grandfather's agricultural and other business ventures. </p><p> Jefferson's assets were not listed in his will. However, during the debate over the Jefferson lottery earlier that year, Monticello and its surrounding acres were valued at $71,000. His properties at Shadwell Mills and in Milton were deemed to be worth $41,500. The publicity over the lottery resulted in two other items in the estate's plus column: $10,000 contributions voted to Martha Randolph by the legislatures of South Carolina and Louisiana. </p><p> In his will, Jefferson gave his country retreat, Poplar Forest, to his grandson, Francis Eppes, the son of Jefferson's deceased daughter Maria and her husband (and cousin) John Wayles Eppes.

So I would definitely use them interactively in a recitation/study group format."<br><br>"The authors have focused on a major problem that many textbooks seem either to ignore or at a minimum fail to recognize and address. Students often master the process of problem solving without understanding the underlying concept that the problem attempts to address. The authors have taken a giant step in addressing this shortcoming."<br><br>"I think these [Concept Explorations] are very beneficial for a few reasons. They go beyond the typical end-of-chapter problems. They are more in-depth and allow connections to be made to concepts in other sections of the chapter. The questions will allow the students to be less focused on trying to remember how the numbers are to be applied to the formulas and more focused on understanding and applying the concept. I think it is advantageous that the problems are in a multi-step format. The students will feel a greater sense of accomplishment as they progress through the problem."<br><br>"These [Strategy Problems] meet the worthy goals of the author. They are well written, adequate in number and rigor, and do not just parrot earlier exercises. I was initially afraid these would be as difficult as some of the 'comprehensive' exercises found in texts, but this was not the case. The only thing that makes them 'difficult' is the lack of an algorithm to follow. Should help push some students toward broader thinking."<br><br>"Great idea. It is too easy to develop a false sense of security applying a standard model to homework problems without understanding chemistry.

The apparatus and materials used in World War I would have been familiar to our remote ancestors. In this classic work, first published in 1960, James Riddick Partington provides a worldwide survey of the evolution of incendiary devices, Greek fire, and gunpowder.</p><p>Greek fire, a composition Partington believes was made of a distilled petroleum fraction and other ingredients (but not saltpetre), was most famously used in the sieges of Constantinople and the Crusades. Partington moves from its antecedents&#x2015;other incendiaries used in ancient warfare&#x2015;to European gunpowder recipe books (<i>The Latin Book of Fire, Bellifortis,</i> and <i>Feuerwerkbuch</i>) and the history of infernal machines, mines, canon, small arms, and artillery. His book includes chapters on gunpowder and weapons in Muslim lands, India, and China&#x2015;including fire books, the use of gunpowder as a propellant, the artillery of the Mughal Emperors, and the use of saltpetre in explosives. He traces the development of gunpowder to eleventh-century China and cites the first known mention and picture of a firearm in 1326. </p><p>"The history of gunpowder and firearms has attracted many authors with varying interests. The general historian must take account of major inventions effecting revolutions in the life of nations. The historian of science is concerned mostly with the invention of gunpowder. The historian of technology examines the development in the manufacture of explosives and weapons, and the way in which gunpowder has found applications in the peaceful arts. The military historian deals mainly with the use of gunpowder as an explosive and a propellant... and the development of firearms and their use in warfare. No recent book in English (or for that matter in any language) has attempted a concise survey of the subject."&#x2015;from the Preface</p></p><p>Warriors have used incendiary weapons from the earliest times. In this comprehensive study, English chemist and historian J.R. Partington traces their origins to Assyrian bas-reliefs from the 9th century, B.C., and even finds hints of them in the Old Testament (see Proverbs 26:18, for instance). Firearms technology took a great leap forward with the advent of so-called Greek fire, used by the Byzantine fleet to defend Constantinople against Arab attackers in the 7th century, and then later versus the Crusaders. One of history's first secret weapons, Greek fire is poorly understood today. Contemporary accounts describe nozzles spouting a fiery liquid that would burn even on the surface of the sea. Experts have tried to determine the exact nature of the substance--the recipe has been lost--but without reaching any definitive conclusions. Partington offers his own theories about one of the great mysteries of premodern warfare. He also describes the advent of gunpowder, exploring the legend of supposed inventor Black Berthold (a mythic figure, says Parrington) and examining the development of firearms in Europe, the Middle East, and China. First published in 1960, <i>A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder</i> is a classic work on the development of military technology. A number of illustrations embellish the text, written in workmanlike prose that is at once scholarly and accessible to serious readers. <i>--John J.

Subjects: Fiction / Classics; Fiction / Literary; Fiction / Psychological; Fiction / Family Life; Literary Criticism / American / General;</p><p><b>The Rise of Silas Lapham</b> (1885) is Howell&#x2019;s best-known work, and this elegant tale of Boston society and manners is rightly regarded as a subtle classic of its time. Silas Lapham inherits his father&#x2019;s paint business, from which he makes a great deal of money, and moves his family from rural Vermont to cosmopolitan Boston. Attempting to break into the city&#x2019;s sophisticated society he becomes bent on the acquisition of both money and social position. Howells contrasts "old" and "new" money, presenting the representatives of both sympathetically and portraying the attempts of the self-made man to break into the world inhabited by those from "established" families with humour and delicacy.Silas Lapham is a rough-hewn entrepreneur who has made his fortune in mineral paint. Socially ambitious for their daughters, Lapham and his wife encourage the suit of Tom Corey, son of an aristocratic Boston family, whose own parents are appalled by his consorting with vulgar upstarts. But which Lapham girl does Tom really love: the pretty blonde Irene or her bookish sister Penelope? As the romantic confusion is sorted out, Lapham suffers calamities that threaten both his financial and personal integrity. His rise is ultimately a moral one. The first major American novel to centre on a businessman, The Rise of Silas Lapham (1885) explores the capitalist ethos of the American Gilded Age. It is also a brilliant novel of manners that shows the comic confrontation of old wealth and new riches.</p><h2>Jill Freedman: Resurrection City, 1968</h2><p><p><strong>The climax of Martin Luther King's Poor People's Campaign</strong></p><p>Published in 1970, Jill Freedman&#x2019;s <i>Old News: Resurrection City</i> documented the culmination of the Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign of 1968, organized by Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and carried out under the leadership of Ralph Abernathy in the wake of Dr King&#x2019;s assassination. Three thousand people set up camp for six weeks in a makeshift town that was dubbed Resurrection City, and participated in daily protests. Freedman lived in the encampment for its entire six weeks, photographing the residents, their daily lives, their protests and their eventual eviction.</p><p>This new 50th-anniversary edition of the book reprints most of the pictures from the original publication, with improved printing and a more vivid design. Alongside Freedman&#x2019;s hard-hitting original text, two introductory essays are included, by John Edwin Mason, historian of African history and the history of photography at the University of Virginia, and by Aaron Bryant, Curator of Photography at the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p><p>The photographs of <b>Jill Freedman</b> (born 1939) are held in the permanent collections of major art institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the International Center of Photography, New York; the New York Public Library; the Jewish Museum, New York; the George Eastman House, Rochester; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. She has had solo exhibitions at numerous museums, including the International Center of Photography, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; and the George Eastman House.

Beautiful. It was the world, squeezed between flimsy snow fences and stinking humanity. There were people there who&#x2019;d give you the shirt off their backs, and others who&#x2019;d kill you for yours. And every type in between. Just a city.

One important difference between the two books is that there is no calculus in the present book. <i>Fundamentals</i> is suitable for undergraduate and graduate elective courses offered by business, economics, and other faculties. In addition, many practitioners who want to improve their understanding of futures and options markets will find the book useful. </p> <p> Instructors can use this book in many different ways. Some may choose to cover only the first eleven chapters, finishing with binomial trees. For those who want to do more, there are many different sequences in which the material in Chapters 12 to 23 can be covered. From Chapter 16 onward, each chapter has been designed so that it is independent of the others and can be included in or omitted from a course without causing problems. I would recommend finishing a course with Chapter 23, which students always find interesting and entertaining. </p> <p><b><i>What's New in This Edition</i></b></p> <ol> <li>There is a new chapter on credit derivatives (Chapter 21).</li> <li>The opening six chapters have been replaced by seven chapters that cover forward, futures, and swap contracts in a more student-friendly way. The chapter on hedging using futures has been moved to Chapter 3. Chapter 4 is now devoted to understanding how interest rates are calculated and used. Chapter 5 covers the determination of futures and forward prices. Chapter 6 deals with interest rate futures and Chapter 7 covers swaps.</li> <li> Forty descriptions of real-world situations and interesting issues, referred to as <i>Business Snapshots,</i> illustrate points being made in the text.</li> <li>There is a new release of DerivaGem (version 1.51), which includes Excel functions and examples of how they can be used.</li> <li>The sequencing of Chapters 15 to 18 has been changed to better meet the needs of students and instructors.</li> <li>The "Introduction to Binomial Trees" chapter has been extended to provide a more complete coverage of binomial trees in one place relatively early in the book.</li> <li>For readers unfamiliar with the exponential and logarithm functions, an explanatory appendix has been added to Chapter 4.</li> <li>The <i>Solutions Manual</i> has been expanded to become a <i>Solutions Manual and Study Guide.</i></li> <li>There have been two changes to the mathematical notation.</li> <li>New end-of-chapter problems have been added.</li> </ol> <p> The book (including end-of-chapter references) has been fully updated.

This consists of two Excel applications: the <i>Options Calculator</i> and the <i>Applications Builder.</i> The Options Calculator consists of the software in the previous release (with minor improvements including the unlocking of worksheets). The Applications Builder consists of a number of Excel functions from which users can build their own applications. It includes a number of sample applications and enables students to explore the properties of options and numerical procedures more easily.

Food and sleep cheer me up. Somehow I reached adulthood without fully recognizing these truths. I knew them in the way that I knew Aaron Burr was the third Vice President of the United States, but I didn't know them in the way that I know not to step in front of oncoming traffic. They weren't built into my instincts. </p><p> With parenthood came wisdom. You can't live with a toddler and fail to discover the palliative benefits of a meal or a nap. Observing those responses in my child, I discovered them in myself. It's helped me to take better care of both of us. </p><p> My daughter Cayley, now aged nine and the apple of her father's eye, strove from infancy to focus my attention on certain principles of applied economics, beginning with the importance of material comforts. Cayley and I have been teaching economics to each other ever since. </p><p> I also teach economics in another guise, as a professor at a university. Professors and parents have a lot in common. A good professor, like a good parent, is there to teach, to learn, and, in the best of circumstances, to rejoice as his students surpass him. </p><p> If you're a parent, then you're an economics teacher. Economics is about facing difficult choices: earning income versus enjoying leisure, splurging today versus saving for tomorrow; developing new skills versus exploiting the skills you've got; searching for the perfect job (or the perfect marriage partner) versus settling for the one that's available. I want my students to think hard about those choices; I want my daughter to think hard about them too. </p><p> One of the great lessons of economics is that there is no single best way to resolve such choices; everything depends on circumstances; what's right for you can be wrong for your neighbor. Economics is the science of tolerance. Good economics professors teach their students that people can live very differently than you do without being either foolish or evil. Good parents teach their children the same thing. </p><p> Economics breeds not just tolerance but compassion. The economist's method is to observe behavior closely, the better to understand other people's goals and other people's difficulties. That kind of understanding is the basis of all compassion. </p><p> I teach a freshman honors seminar in economics.

Here are some of the better answers: Today's working women can't shop every week the way their mothers did; they (or their husbands) must stock up more on each infrequent trip. Or: Today's working women can't cook dinner for the entire family as their mothers did; instead they buy enough food so that mom, dad, and the kids can all fend for themselves. Or: Today's wealthier families serve a greater variety of dishes at each meal. Or: Today's wealthier shoppers are willing to pay higher grocery prices for luxuries like wide aisles and the carts those aisles can accommodate. Or: Today's larger houses provide more storage space in the pantry. Or: Today's ubiquitous ATM machines mean that shoppers are no longer constrained by their unwillingness to carry lots of cash. </p><p> If things go well, students challenge each others' answers in insightful ways. One student says that today's shoppers buy more because advertising techniques have become more effective. Another objects that with a given income, shoppers who buy more of one product must necessarily buy less of another. </p><p> The point of the exercise is not to understand shopping carts; it's to understand the technique of understanding. To succeed at this game, students must be sensitive to the problems of families very unlike their own. Learning to see the world through someone else's eyes is an essential part of economic training; it's also an essential part of growing up. </p><p> There are a lot of good questions to practice on. Next year I think I'll ask my students why two-earner families generally save less than one-earner families with identical incomes. Is it because the two-earner family hires a housekeeper? Is it because working mothers care less about their children's future than stay-at-home mothers do? Is it because working mothers provide such good role models that their children can make it on their own without a large inheritance? </p><p> Or else I'll ask why, in every culture, men are far more likely than women to commit suicide. Is it because women feel a greater obligation to continue caring for their offspring? Or is it because women live longer, and can therefore look forward to surviving the spouse who is making life unbearable? </p><p> Teaching this stuff is a lot like parenting, really. When my daughter comes home in distress because she thinks she's been slighted in the schoolyard, I can help by encouraging her to imagine events through the other kids' eyes. There's a technique to that kind of imagination. You make a guess; you ask if it seems plausible; you check whether it's consistent with all the evidence; you refine your guess. That's exactly how a good economics student thinks about shopping carts. </p><p> Economics is about more than just individual choices. It's also about social choices: rewarding initiative versus promoting equality; preserving freedom versus preserving order; providing opportunities for the masses versus providing a safety net for the least fortunate. In other words, we want to ask: What is right? What is just? What is fair? My daughter is keenly interested in the same questions, more concretely posed: Is her allowance an entitlement or a reward for a clean room? Should she be free to ignore her parents' advice and wear a summer jacket on a winter day? Should she and her friends choose a video that most of them love or a video that none of them hates? Every time a child cries "That's not fair!", a parent is forced to confront some issue of economic justice. </p><p> I am bilingual. In the classroom, I speak the language of graphs and equations; in the living room I speak the language of dreams and imagination and the drying of tears. In the classroom I talk abstractly about the advantages of writing an enforceable contract; in the living room I talk concretely about why Cayley's friend Jessica doesn't like her to change the rules of checkers in the middle of a game. In the classroom I talk about the general problem of delineating property rights; in the living room I talk about the specific moral issues raised when one child lays claim to a quarter of the communal sandbox. Being bilingual doesn't mean you have twice as much to talk about; it means only that you get to talk about the same things twice. </p><p> But here's something odd: Sometimes issues that seem murky and difficult in the language of the classroom become clear and simple in the language of the living room, and sometimes the reverse is true. This suggests that parents and economists have a lot to teach each other. </p><p> That's what this book is about. It's a patchwork of essays about issues -- basic human issues like fairness and justice and responsibility -- that both parents and economists are forced to confront. It's about principles of right and wrong which are obvious to every parent, but must be taught to wayward children and wayward economists. It's about techniques of understanding. It's about teaching economics, and using ideas from economics to teach tolerance and compassion and intellectual rigor. It's about using economics to understand the family, and using the structure of the family to illuminate issues in economics. </p><p> Every now and then, an insightful college student challenges a professor and turns out to be right. To a conscientious professor, that's the most joyful experience you can have in a classroom. Parents -- at least the kind of parents who encourage the lively exchange of ideas among family members -- have ample opportunity to feel the same kind of joy. So do opinionated authors, if their readers are attentive. The arguments in this book are the product of sustained and careful thought, and they seem to me to be right. But when they're wrong, I hope that in the spirit of the classroom and the family dinner table, you'll let me know. </p><p> Copyright � 1997 by Steven Landsburg</p></p><h2>The Best Shotguns Ever Made in America: Seven Vintage Doubles to Shoot and to Treasure</h2><p>Looks at the history and design of the Parker, L.

It is divided into two main parts. The author concentrates on multiple regression analysis in the first part and structural equation modeling in the second part. Provides an introduction to multiple regression analysis, path analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. Students gain a foundation in multiple regression. Multiple regression is used as a jumping-off place for structural equation modeling with measured variables (path analysis). Latent variables are introduced as a way of obviating some of the threats to path models, and SEM with latent variables is presented as the culmination of the previous topics.

By focusing on the concepts and purposes of MR and related methods, rather than the derivation and calculation of formulae (the &#x201c;plug and chug&#x201d; approach), students learn more clearly, in a less threatening way. As a result, they are more likely to be interested in conducting research using MR, CFA, or SEM and are more likely to use the methods wisely. <p> This is undoubtedly the most readable book about multiple regression I have ever used. My students found it clear and understandable. Keith writes in a clear style that is designed to engage students rather than alienate them. The emphasis is on conceptual understanding rather than mathematical proofs. Formulas are used when necessary, but Keith takes care not to drown students in a sea of algebra. The aim throughout is to empower students to make the decisions that they will need to make in thier own research.<br> <i>Larry Greil, Alfred University</i> </p><p> Keith's approach is a conceptually oriented introduction to multiple regression. None of the negative connotations of that phrase apply here. Keith's coverage de-emphasizes complex mathematics yet is committed to a rigorous, model-building use of multiple regression in research data analysis. . . . Material that can be quite difficult and confusing for students is covered with sufficient depth and clarity so that many issues will make considerably more sense to students than they usually do.<br> <i>Robert J.

The basic concepts presented in this book are far more fundamental than the mother sciences of engineering (i.e., physics and mathematics) and cover the essential truth about our physical universe in which we live. These basic truths convey a much deeper understanding about the nature of the physical universe than has ever been discussed in any RF and microwave, or for that matter any scientific textbook. </p><p>These basic truths set up a background of discovered knowledge by mankind, against which a smaller sphere of information (i.e., RF and microwave engineering) can be examined. Many of the principles that appear in microwave books are easily describable and thus understood much better once the basic underlying concepts are grasped.</p><p>While studying sciences and engineering at the university, the author always looked for simplicity, a higher truth, and a deeper level of understanding in all of the rigorous mathematics and many of the physical laws that were presented. Upon further investigation, the underlying principles that form the backbone of all extant physical sciences have finally emerged and are presented as the fundamentals of physical sciences in Chapter 1 of this work. </p><p>A summary of philosophical formation of this work is presented in the form of a pyramid in Chapter 1. From this pyramid, we can see that workable knowledge is like a pyramid, where from a handful of common denominators efficiently expressed by a series of basic postulates, axioms, and natural laws, which form the foundation of a science, an almost innumerable number of devices, circuits, and systems can be thought up and developed. The plethora of the mass of devices, circuits, and systems generated is known as the application mass, which practically approaches infinity in sheer number. This is an important point to grasp, because the foundation portion never changes (a static) while the base area of the pyramid is an ever-changing and evolving arena (a kinetic) where this evolution is in terms of new implementation techniques and technologies.</p><p>Following this brief introduction, the fundamental laws and basic principles of electrical engineering, which most advanced textbooks take for granted, are discussed. The reason for their presentation at this early stage, is that in dealing with the subject of RF and microwave engineering, it has been found that a lack of deeper understanding of these fundamentals leads to a shallow perspective and a lack of appreciation of electrical engineering basics, which will eventually lead to serious miscomprehension and misapplication of the subject.</p><p>This book is written with emphasis on fundamentals and for this reason all new technical terms are thoroughly defined in the body of the text as they are introduced. This novel approach is based upon the results obtained in recent investigations and research in the field of education, which has shown that the lack of (or the slightest uncertainty on) the definition of terms poses as one of the most formidable obstacles in the reader's mind in achieving full comprehension of the material. A series of uncomprehended or misunderstood technical terms will block one's road to total comprehension and mastery of the subject. This undesirable condition will eventually lead to a dislike and total abandonment of the subject.</p><p>The initial motivation was to bring the basics to the forefront and orient the reader in such a way that he or she can think with these fundamentals correctly. This eventually led to writing the first manuscript several years ago and then the final preparation of this book at present.</p><p>In preparing this book, the emphasis was shifted from rigorous and sophisticated mathematical solutions of Maxwell's equations and instead has been aptly placed on RF and microwave circuit analysis and design principles using simple concepts while emphasizing the basics all the way.</p><p>This book is intended to be used in a 2-semester course in microwave electronics engineering for senior-level or graduate students and should serve as an excellent reference guide for the practicing RF and microwave engineer in the field as well. </p><p>The current work starts from very general postulates, considerations and laws and, chapter by chapter, narrows the focus to very specific concepts and applications, culminating in the design of various RF and microwave circuits. The book, divided into five parts and 21 chapters, develops and presents these chapters with the progressive development of concepts following the same pattern as presented in the pyramid of knowledge in Chapter 1, which is:</p><p>Part I &nbsp; The Highest Fundamentals</p><p>Chapters 1- 4 form the foundation of electronics. </p><p>Part II &nbsp; Wave Propagation in Networks</p><p>Chapters 5-8 present the basics of RF and Microwave science, wave propagation, and network characterization concepts.</p><p>Part III &nbsp; Passive Circuit Design</p><p>Chapters 9-11 deal with the Smith Chart and its numerous applications to matching circuits.</p><p>Part IV &nbsp; Basic Considerations in Active Networks</p><p>Chapters 12-14 discuss the basic considerations of circuit design.</p><p>Part V &nbsp; Active Networks: Linear and Nonlinear Design</p><p>Chapters 15-21 provide detailed analysis and design methodologies of linear and nonlinear active circuits.</p><p>A list of symbols used in each chapter and a series of problems are included at the end of each chapter to help the reader gain a fuller understanding of the presented materials. The book ends with a glossary of technical terms and several important appendixes. These appendixes cover physical constants and other important data needed in the analysis or design process, with one appendix fully devoted to several design examples of practical active circuits using computer-aided design techniques based on the "Libra/touchstone" ? software Ver. 6.1 from HPEEsof.</p><p> Foreword by Dr. Asad Madni, C.

Originally composed between 1950 and 1962, it derives its title from the lengthy critical commentary which Bion attached to these case histories in the year of publication, 1967, and represents the evolutionary change of position marked in his three previous books and brought to further refinement in the present work.</p></p><p>Wilfred R. Bion (1897 -1979) was born in India and first came to England at the age of eight to receive his schooling. During the First World War he served in France as a tank commander and was awarded the DSO and the Legion of Honour. After reading history at Queen&#x2019;s College, Oxford, he studied medicine at University College London, before a growing interest in psychoanalysis led him to undergo training analysis with John Rickman and, later, Melanie Klein. During the 1940s his attention was directed to the study of group processes. Abandoning his work in this field in favor of psychoanalytic practice, he subsequently rose to the position of Director of the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis (1956-62) and President of the British Psychoanalytical Society (1962-65). From 1968 he worked in Los Angeles, returning to England two months before his death in 1979. A pioneer in group dynamics, he was associated with the 'Tavistock group', the group of pioneering psychologists that founded the Tavistock Institute in 1946 on the basis of their shared wartime experiences. He later wrote the influential Experiences in Groups, in 1961, an important guide for the group psychotherapy and encounter group movements beginning in the 1960s, and which quickly became a touchstone work for applications of group theory in a wide variety of fields. Bion's training included an analysis with Melanie Klein following World War II. He was a leading member in the Kleinian school while in London, but his theories, which were always based in the phenomena of the analytic encounter, eventually revealed radical departures from both Kleinian and Freudian theory. While Bion is most well known outside of the psychoanalytic community for his work on group dynamics, the psychoanalytic conversation that explores his work is concerned with his theory of thinking and his model of the development of a capacity for thought.Second Thoughts, a collection of papers composed between 1950 and 1962, derives its title from the lengthy critical commentary which Bion attached to these case histories in the year of publication, 1967, and represents the evolutionary change of position marked in his three previous books and brought to further refinement in the present work.</p><h2>Grammar for Gemara &amp; Targum Onkelos An Introduction To Aramaic</h2><p>Grammar for Gemara and Targum Onkelos: an Introduction to Aramaic, by Yitzhak Frank, is an exceptional resource for those wishing to read, learn, and translate the Talmud Bavli or Targum Onkelos.

The stories, originally published in The New Yorker magazine, concern Franny and Zooey Glass, two members of the family that was the subject of most of Salinger's short fiction. Franny is an intellectually precocious late adolescent who tries to attain spiritual purification by obsessively reiterating the "Jesus prayer" as an antidote to the perceived superficiality and corruptness of life. She subsequently suffers a nervous breakdown. In the second story, her next older brother, Zooey, attempts to heal Franny by pointing out that her constant repetition of the "Jesus prayer" is as self-involved and egotistical as the egotism against which she rails. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>The Man Who Was Thursday (Crime Classics)</h2><p><strong>A group of anarchists dedicated to overthrowing the world order are under surveillance by Scotland Yard and are about to be infiltrated, in this&nbsp;fast-moving, funny, surreal detective story with a highly anarchic take on anarchy</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Gabriel Syme is dispatched by Scotland Yard on a secret mission to infiltrate the Central Anarchist Council&#x2014;an organization plotting to bring down the existing social order.

It is a fascinating mystery, a spellbinding allegory, and an entirely chilling classic of crime fiction.</strong></p><p>In an article published the day before his death, G.K. Chesterton called <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> "a very melodramatic sort of moonshine." Set in a phantasmagoric London where policemen are poets and anarchists camouflage themselves as, well, anarchists, his 1907 novel offers up one highly colored enigma after another. If that weren't enough, the author also throws in an elephant chase and a hot-air-balloon pursuit in which the pursuers suffer from "the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon." <p> But Chesterton is also concerned with more serious questions of honor and truth (and less serious ones, perhaps, of duels and dualism). Our hero is Gabriel Syme, a policeman who cannot reveal that his fellow poet Lucian Gregory is an anarchist. In Chesterton's agile, antic hands, Syme is the virtual embodiment of paradox: </p><blockquote> He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art and self-realization; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinthe and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.... Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing left--sanity. </blockquote> Elected undercover into the Central European Council of anarchists, Syme must avoid discovery <i>and</i> save the world from any bombings in the offing. As Thursday (each anarchist takes the name of a weekday--the only quotidian thing about this fantasia) does his best to undo his new colleagues, the masks multiply. The question then becomes: Do they reveal or conceal? And who, not to mention what, can be believed? As <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> proceeds, it becomes a hilarious numbers game with a more serious undertone--what happens if most members of the council actually turn out to be on the side of right? Chesterton's tour de force is a thriller that is best read slowly, so as to savor his highly anarchic take on anarchy. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>G. K. Chesterton&#39;s surreal masterpiece is a psychological thriller that centers on seven anarchists in turn-of-the-century London who call themselves by the names of the days of the week. Chesterton explores the meanings of their disguised identities in what is a fascinating mystery and, ultimately, a spellbinding allegory. As Jonathan Lethem remarks in his Introduction, The real characters are the ideas. Chesterton&#39;s nutty agenda is really quite simple: to expose moral relativism and parlor nihilism for the devils he believes them to be. This wouldn&#39;t be interesting at all, though, if he didn&#39;t also show such passion for giving the devil his due. He animates the forces of chaos and anarchy with every ounce of imaginative verve and rhetorical force in his body.</p><h2>Power System Analysis and Design, Fifth Edition</h2><p>The new edition of POWER SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN provides students with an introduction to the basic concepts of power systems along with tools to aid them in applying these skills to real world situations.

The author demonstrates, first, how the tensions generated between slaves and masters can be perceived in the ancient sources, and, second, how those tensions were dealt with, as masters treated their slaves with varying forms of generosity and punishment in order to elicit obedience from them. Special attention is given to the slaves' family lives, to their acquisition of freedom through manumission, and to the climate of violence that surrounded them. Emphasizing the harsh realities of Roman slavery in a new way, this important book will stir intense debate among scholars and students.<br></p><p>K. R.

The authors&#x2019; years of teaching experience resulted in a text that reflects how students generally use a textbook: they start in the exercises and refer back to the narrative for help as needed. The text therefore builds from a foundation of meticulously crafted exercise sets, then draws students into the narrative through writing that reflects the voice of the instructor, examples that are stepped out and thoughtfully annotated, and figures that are designed to teach rather than simply supplement the narrative. The authors appeal to students&#x2019; geometric intuition to introduce fundamental concepts, laying a foundation for the rigorous development that follows. <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This book covers chapters single variable topics (chapters 1&#x2014;12) of <b>Calculus for Scientists and Engineers</b>, which is an expanded version of <b>Calculus</b> by the same authors.</p></p><p><p> <b>William Briggs </b>has been on the mathematics faculty at the University of Colorado at Denver for twenty-three years.

Author: Johan Pries</p><h2>Bodies in the Bog and the Archaeological Imagination</h2><p><p></p>Over the past few centuries, northern Europe&#x2019;s bogs have yielded mummified men, women, and children who were deposited there as sacrifices in the early Iron Age and kept startlingly intact by the chemical properties of peat. In this remarkable account of their modern afterlives, Karin Sanders argues that the discovery of bog bodies began an extraordinary&#x2014;and ongoing&#x2014;cultural journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Sanders shows, these eerily preserved remains came alive in art and science as material metaphors for such concepts as trauma, nostalgia, and identity. Sigmund Freud, Joseph Beuys, Seamus Heaney, and other major figures have used them to reconsider fundamental philosophical, literary, aesthetic, and scientific concerns. Exploring this intellectual spectrum, Sanders contends that the power of bog bodies to provoke such a wide range of responses is rooted in their unique status as both archeological artifacts and human beings. They emerge as corporeal time capsules that transcend archaeology to challenge our assumptions about what we can know about the past. By restoring them to the roster of cultural phenomena that force us to confront our ethical and aesthetic boundaries, <i>Bodies in the Bog </i>excavates anew the question of what it means to be human.<p></p></p><p><p><b>Karin Sanders </b>is professor of Scandinavian studies at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>&#x201c;A rare conjunction of brilliant research with lyrical feeling. At once gripping, enlightening, and deeply moving, this stunning book offers a mind-boggling trek across space and time, life and death, torment and ecstasy. By turns ventriloquist and taxidermist, Karin Sanders resurrects bog beings from the limbo of their burial. They are reborn through the curious eyes and creative hands of poets and painters, sculptors and scholars, as both saints and ghosts&#x2014;like saints miraculously indestructible, like ghosts haunting us with eerie memories. And her fabulous bog bodies at length mirror ourselves. They are our own doppelg�ngers, doubles displaced from time immemorial.&#x201d;</p><p></p> (David Lowenthal, University College London)<br><br><p>&#x201c;What a wonderful, wonderful book this is. I absolutely loved <i>Bodies in the Bog</i> and everything about it, from the thoughtful approach and beautiful writing to the well-contextualized discussions of bog bodies in psychology, poetry, art, museum display, and facial reconstruction. A truly interdisciplinary study clearly based on years of passionate research, it offers a rich and nuanced explanation of what makes these bodies so fascinating, appealing, and troubling.&#x201d;</p> (Stephanie Moser, University of Southampton)<br><br><p>&#x201c;For me, archaeology has its muses; in Karin Sanders&#x2019;s hands, these muses are very much with us, for she understands archaeology in relation to the literature, the poetry, the historical trajectories of each and every find. In her study of bog people, Sanders has brought together many voices that are not usually in conversation, presenting a dramatically new set of interlocking perspectives&#x2014;a new kaleidoscopic pattern. This book is a delight to read, a skillful and ingenious accomplishment, a dexterous weaving of new ideas about a much-debated phenomenon that has long sparked our imaginations.&nbsp; What Sanders has done here makes me rejoice in what a creative mind can do, and in how readers will inevitably come away with all sorts of new understandings. Brava!&#x201d;</p> (Margaret Conkey, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br><p>"I found this book a joy to read because, unlike most archaeological studies, it combines scholarship with superb literary style, the whole salted by the provision of numerous imaginative pathways. I, for one, will never study or write about bog bodies in the same way again and I will try to ensure that the same is true of my students. Despite the few caveats mentioned above, it is a work of true originality that lifts bog victims out of their purely archaeological dimension and travels with them on a journey towards enlightenment. Early on in the study, the author speaks of bog bodies being embalmed with words. That is nowhere more true than in this book."</p> (Miranda Aldhouse-Green <i>Australian Archaeological Association</i>)<br><br>"[Sanders] deftly teases out the paradoxes: born of neither land nor water but something in between: the bodies are the uncanny link between the pagan belief that prompted their death and our own prejudices. . . . Equally entertaining is Sanders' commentary on Freud and Jung, describing how the famous schism between the two psychologists was prompted by their disagreement over the meaning of the bog bodies."&#x2014;Philip Hoare, <i>Sunday Telegraph&nbsp;</i> (Sunday Telegraph)<br><br>"Sanders has uncovered a fascinated range of examples of literature and art which has responded to the peaty mummies. . . .

Born the obscure daughter of an obscure Manchu officer in 1835, Tzu's notorious ride to fame and power began in the imperial concubinage in 1856, when she gave birth to a boy heir. Seagrave's aim here is primarily to destroy longstanding myths about this most powerful of Chinese women, myths created by Western imperialist adventurers of pen and sword who painted her as the Wicked Witch of the East. The author's primary target and culprit is the infamous British literary agent Edmund Backhouse. Living in China at the turn of the century, Backhouse apparently culled gossip and rumor and fabricated evidence in order to coauthor, with J.O.P. Bland, the influential 1910 book China Under the Dowager Empress--which, according to Seagrave, presented a ``bloodthirsty caricature'' of Tzu that mixed ``Western fantasy and Chinese pornography.'' Backhouse reported that Tzu's ascent to power included killing off enemies with poisoned cakes, keeping hordes of false eunuchs close at hand, and choreographing wild sexual escapades in the Imperial Palace--escapades to which Backhouse claimed invitation. Seagrave relies partly on Hugh Trevor-Roper's Hermit of Peking (1974) to expose Backhouse as a prurient fraud who willfully set out to create a fictitious empress who would satiate Western stereotypes of sex-starved Asian women and justify British adventuring inside China. Seagrave also exposes other Western writers--including Pearl Buck--who perpetuated Backhouse's seamy portrait. An engrossing, fact-filled read and masterful debunking of a troubling distortion of Chinese history. (Sixteen pages of illustrations--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This has never been truer than in <i>Long Life</i> , a luminous collection of seventeen essays and ten poems. With the grace and precision that are the hallmarks of her work, Oliver shows us how writing "is a way of offering praise to the world" and suggests we see her poems as "little alleluias." Whether describing a goosefish stranded at low tide, the feeling of being baptized by the mist from a whale's blowhole, or the "connection between soul and landscape," Oliver invites readers to find themselves and their experiences at the center of her world. In Long Life she also speaks of poets and writers: Wordsworth's "whirlwind" of "beauty and strangeness"; Hawthorne's "sweet-tempered" side; and Emerson's belief that "a man's inclination, once awakened to it, would be to turn all the heavy sails of his life to a moral purpose." With consummate craftsmanship, Mary Oliver has created a breathtaking volume sure to add to her reputation as "one of our very best poets" ( <i>New York Times Book Review</i> ).</p><p><b>Mary Oliver</b> is the author of twenty books, including <i>The Leaf and the Cloud</i> and <i>What Do We Know</i> . Her many accolades include the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. She lives in Provincetown, Massachusetts.Winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for her poetry, Oliver also writes exquisitely lucid prose. Here, in her most generously personal essays to date, she articulates the beliefs, observations, and inspirations that feed her poetry as she contemplates the majestic beauty of the earth and its splendid creatures, including humankind. Oliver ponders death and remembrance, marvels over the unexpected boon of an old town dump, considers the indelible impression left by childhood revelations of the power and mystery of nature, and reveals her literary legacy in a set of sterling tributes to Wordsworth, Emerson, and Hawthorne. And, finally, this essential American poet literally brings it all home in a radiant reflection on the crucial "connection between soul and landscape." <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The author, a leading developmental psychologist, views development as an apprenticeship in which children engage in the use of intellectual tools in societally structured activities with parents, other adults, and children. The author has gathered evidence from various disciplines--cognitive, developmental, and cultural psychology; anthropology; infancy studies; and communication research--furnishing a coherent and broadly based account of cognitive development in its sociocultural context. This work examines the mutual roles of the individual and the sociocultural world, and the culturally based processes by which children appropriate and extend skill and understanding from their involvement in shared thinking with other people. The book is written in a lively and engaging style and is supplemented by photographs and original illustrations by the author.<br></p><p><br><strong>Barbara Rogoff</strong> is currently Professor of Psychology and Coordinator of the Developmental Psychology Program at the University of Utah.<br>"Every student of language learning should read this book.

The author investigates the strengths and weaknesses of Philip&#x2019;s strategic vision, the priorities that underlay his policies, the practices and prejudices that influenced his decision-making, and the external factors that affected the achievement of his goals.<br><br>Geoffrey Parker begins by defining the characteristics of Spain&#x2019;s strategic culture: the king&#x2019;s distinctive system of government, the &#x201c;information overload&#x201d; that threatened to engulf it, and the various strategic priorities and assumptions used to overcome the disparity between aims and means. He then explores the surviving documentation (from the Habsburgs, their allies, and their adversaries) on the formation of strategy in three crucial case studies: Philip&#x2019;s unsuccessful efforts to maintain his authority in the Netherlands, his defective peacetime management of foreign relations with Scotland and England, and his failed Armada campaign against England. Finally Parker examines the small but fatal flaws in the execution of Philip&#x2019;s Grand Strategy, assesses the response of the king and his ministers to their failures, and questions whether the outcome might have been different with other policy options, another ruler, or a different strategic culture. Pointing to modern parallels between Philip&#x2019;s problems of governance and those facing Hitler and Churchill, or Kennedy and Johnson, this powerfully argued book provides a fascinating commentary on the nature of empires and the decision-making process as practiced by great powers.<br></p><p>In the second half of the 16th century, Spain's Philip II ruled over the original empire on which the sun never set. In Europe alone, he held power over Portugal, the Netherlands, and about half of Italy (including Sicily, the Duchy of Milan, and the Kingdom of Naples). On the African shores of the Mediterranean, he controlled Tunis and Tangier; further south were Guinea and Angola. There were holdings in India and--well, naturally--the Philippines, and in the Western hemisphere, there were Florida, Cuba, Brazil, Peru, and "New Spain," which occupied the modern American Southwest and all of Mexico and Central America.<p> Most historians have claimed that, in overseeing this empire, Philip had no "Grand Strategy," but instead occupied himself with perpetual reaction to events. But Geoffrey Parker believes that there was a "strategic culture" that influenced Philip's reign, and he makes extensive use of surviving correspondence from the period to demonstrate how that culture revealed itself in Spain's attempts to hang onto the Netherlands and in its relationship--diplomatic and martial--to England. <i>The Grand Strategy of Philip II</i> is a richly detailed history, which will reward any student of modern statecraft with its insights into geopolitical power.</p>Geoffrey Parker is Andreas Dorpalen Professor of History at The Ohio State University.</p><h2>Children and Their Families: The Continuum of Nursing Care</h2><p>Succeed in your pediatric nursing course with <b>Children and Their Families</b> , <b>Third Edition!</b> This bestselling text has already helped thousands of students master the concepts and skills necessary for effective practice in a variety of settings, from home to school to medical center. <br>The book&#x2019;s easy-to-understand presentation, striking visuals, and built-in learning tools help you develop an understanding of the unique role you&#x2019;ll have in working with all members of the pediatric healthcare system and equip you to make critical judgments and decisions in a variety of settings across the continuum of care."<br><ul><li>Broaden your understanding of the interrelated dynamics of pediatric nursing care and make the leap from theory to practice, through <b><i>Progressive Case Studies</i></b> that follow a community of pediatric clients through each chapter.</li><li>Learn to create and implement care plans through <b><i>Nursing Plan of Care</i></b> features.</li><li>Develop an understanding of important psychosocial, teaching, physiologic, or pathophysiologic differences among children of various age groups with handy <b><i>Developmental Consideration</i></b> charts.</li><li>Prepare for effective practice with <b><i>Care Paths</i></b> that summarize the interdisciplinary plan of care for a child with a specific condition and include nursing diagnoses to alert the health care team to current or potential issues that require intervention.</li><li>Learn the skills you need for effective client/family education with <b><i>Teaching Intervention Plans (TIPs)</i></b> that present interdisciplinary plans focused on aspects of care involving child and/or family education.</li><li>Evaluate and improve your critical thinking skills with <b><i>Clinical Judgments</i></b> features.</li><li>Develop the skills you need to work with families in community settings through <b><i>Community Care Charts</i></b> that present special teachings and clinical information.</li><li>Master important information through <b><i>Nursing Intervention Charts</i></b> that provide a more in-depth description of particular nursing care activities.</li><li>Learn how to assess disorders in various body systems through <b><i>Focused Health History chart</i></b> s that summarize specific health history information.</li><li>Identify abnormal findings through a <b><i>Focused Physical Assessment chart</i></b> that highlights assessment findings and explains what would be considered an abnormal finding.</li><li>Prepare for clinical practice with <b><i>Nursing Diagnoses and Outcomecharts</i></b> that summarize the nursing diagnoses and outcomes that are consistently applicable to defined populations of children with specific health challenges.</li><li>Enhance your understanding of how children are cared for in other cultures through <b><i>Cross-Cultural Care</i></b> boxes.</li><li>Develop an understanding of how research informs pediatric practice through <b><i>Evidence-Based Practice</i></b> boxes.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Murasaki Shikibu: The Tale of Genji (Landmarks of World Literature (New))</h2><p>Murasaki Shikibu&#39;s The Tale of Genji, written in Japan in the early eleventh century, is acknowledged to be one of Japan&#39;s greatest literary achievements, and sometimes thought of as the world&#39;s first novel.

The lessons he learned and the methods he uses should be required reading for anyone whose business relies on the art of negotiation. Ron never forgets that treating people with respect and fairness is the key to success. Ron and Mark have been helping our company for many years-I guess we won't need them anymore-they put it all in their book." -Charles M. Cawley Chief Executive Officer, MBNA America Bank, N.A.<br> <br> "In the field of negotiation Ron Shapiro has always been regarded as the quintessence of class and integrity. Predictably, he and Mark Jankowski have written a compelling book filled with anecdotes and insights. The Power of Nice is a fascinating and useful book that is a must read for anyone who wants to build long-term mutually profitable relationships." -Herb Cohen Author, You Can Negotiate Anything<br> <br> "This book taught me everything I ever wanted to know about negotiation-and I use it everyday." -Kirby Puckett Former All-Star Center Fielder and Executive Vice President, Minnesota Twins<br> <br> "Negotiation is not war.<br> <br> Negotiation is not a science. Negotiation is the commerce of information for ultimate gain." -from The Power of Nice<br> <br> Though not a science, negotiating is an art, and in this eye-opening new book, a true master shares his secrets and strategies for success. Ron Shapiro is a corporate lawyer, teacher, and, in what is almost a contradiction in terms, one of today's most respected sports agents. He has worked with baseball's biggest names: Cal Ripken, Jr., Kirby Puckett, Brooks Robinson, Dennis Martinez, Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, and many others. Rising to-and remaining at-the top of a competitive pool filled with smooth-talking, "sleazeball" sharks, he has succeeded by being, of all things, a nice guy. Now, along with his business partner, lawyer, lecturer, and negotiations expert, Mark Jankowski, Shapiro reveals how anyone who sits down to make a deal can get what they want by exercising the surprising "power of nice." Together, Shapiro and Jankowski have shared their negotiation insights with Fortune 500 companies, entrepreneurs, universities, and government agencies.<br> <br> Though the name of the game in negotiating is to obtain desired results, how you get them is just as important. While many dealmakers play hardball by assuming a winner-take-all, scorched-earth attitude, they do so at the risk of alienating the party opposite them at the negotiating table, thereby losing out on future opportunities. This approach is, as Shapiro and Jankowski tell us, a major strike against effective negotiating, and can-and should-be avoided. By using a kinder, gentler approach that focuses on forming-and keeping-strong business connections, ultimate gain can still be yours: "You can be 'a nice guy' and still get what you're after. In fact, you often get better results, achieve more of your goals, and build longer-term relationships with even greater returns."<br> <br> Drawing on their vast experience in win-win negotiating, as well as such essentials as managing tough situations, handling difficult negotiators, and unlocking deadlocks, the authors take you, step-by-step, through a systematic approach that, when repeated and mastered, will maximize results. Based on "the three Ps," it consists of: preparing better than the other side; probing so you know what they want and why; and proposing, ideally without going first and revealing too much, but still achieving what you want.<br> <br> Supported by invaluable "portable" negotiation summaries-so you can take the "power of nice" with you-this is must reading for anyone who has to make a deal, whether it's negotiating with a customer, setting a curfew with a teenager, or getting the last seat on an over-sold airplane.</p><p>Anyone who is faced with making a deal--whether it be with a corporate adversary or a car salesman--will find <i>The Power of Nice</i> to be a very helpful guide through the potentially harrowing give-and-take that is, by definition, a regular part of the negotiating process. Packed with observations and anecdotes drawn from the experience of authors Ronald Shapiro and Mark Jankowski--partners in a negotiations seminar and consulting firm that counts baseball superstars Cal Ripkin Jr., Brooks Robinson, and Jim Palmer among its clientele--the book shows how to reorient the overall process from an exercise in antagonism to one in which everybody wins (but you win bigger). It is based on "the three Ps," which Shapiro and Jankowski describe as "preparing better than the other side; probing so you know what they want and why; and proposing, ideally without going first and revealing too much." All of the chapters, such as those on handling difficult competitors, bargaining from a position of weakness, eliminating obstacles, and building long-term relationships, are filled with checklists and exercises that help readers absorb the authors' suggestions and turn themselves into better negotiators. <i>--Howard Rothman</i>Ronald Shapiro has been called one of the &#34;most respected sports agent-attorneys in baseball.&#34; His stellar list of clients includes Cal Ripken, Jr., Kirby Puckett, Eddie Murray, Hall of Fame&#39;s Jim Palmer, and Brooks Robinson. One of the reasons for Shapiro&#39;s impressive track record is his unparalleled success in the realm of negotiation. This is the first book ever to offer the unique ideas and strategies of the man who knows how to make a deal where everybody wins. Shapiro&#39;s approach to negotiation is centered around, first and foremost, the importance of building relationships. He is most interested in finding the common threads between the parties involved in the deal, whether it is common family responsibilities, complex personal lives, or business obligations. It is these common threads, Shapiro believes, that can completely affect the outcome of any bargaining session. Shapiro also covers timely topics such as win-lose negotiations, win-win negotiations, listening, preparation proposals, personality types, and unlocking deadlocks.</p><h2>Learn-A-Language Books Spanish, Grade 2</h2><p>This new series uses a simple approach to help kids master the basics of the Spanish language including sentence structure, vocabulary, pronunciation, and verbs.

It starts from the fundamental concept of universal grammar as a property of the human mind, consisting of universal principles of language and parameters that vary within limits from one language to another. The implications of this are explored for first language acquisition, concentrating on the contribution of the mind and on the nature of the language evidence necessary. An outline of the sub-theories of GB and their relationship is presented, dealing with topics such as the X-bar theory in syntax, syntactic movement and case theory, with government a pervasive syntactic relationship in the theory. Chomsky&#39;s writings of the 1980s are incorporated together with lectures on GB theory, including ideas represented in the Managua and Kyoto lectures.</p><p>The theory of Universal Grammar is central to the concerns of present-day linguistics. The book is intended as an introduction for those who want a broad overview of the theory with sufficient detail to see how its main concepts work. The new edition of this highly successful textbook incorporates recent developments in the field. <br> <p><i>Chomsky's Universal Grammar</i> introduces both the general concepts of the theory, particularly its goals of describing the knowledge of language and of accounting for how it is acquired, and the main areas of syntax such as X-bar theory, movement and government. Like the first edition, it puts the technicalities of the theory in the context of its wider ideas in a manner that makes them accessible to the student. The new edition is based on the current model of syntax that is most widely accepted, incorporating Barriers syntax, functional categories, and Relativized Minimality, and their implications for language acquisition. Further, it provides a sketch of the model in the process of development, the Minimalist Programme, with its attempt to reduce the theory to the minimal essentials.</p><b>Vivian Cook </b>is Reader in Linguistics at the University of Essex and <b>Mark Newson </b>is Senior Lecturer in the School of English and American Studies at Eotuos Lorand University, Hungary.</p><h2>Whose America?: Culture Wars in the Public Schools</h2><p><p>What do America's children learn about American history, American values, and human decency? Who decides? In this absorbing book, Jonathan Zimmerman tells the dramatic story of conflict, compromise, and more conflict over the teaching of history and morality in twentieth-century America. </p><p>In history, whose stories are told, and how? As Zimmerman reveals, multiculturalism began long ago. Starting in the 1920s, various immigrant groups--the Irish, the Germans, the Italians, even the newly arrived Eastern European Jews--urged school systems and textbook publishers to include their stories in the teaching of American history. The civil rights movement of the 1960s and '70s brought similar criticism of the white version of American history, and in the end, textbooks and curricula have offered a more inclusive account of American progress in freedom and justice. </p><p>But moral and religious education, Zimmerman argues, will remain on much thornier ground. In battles over school prayer or sex education, each side argues from such deeply held beliefs that they rarely understand one another's reasoning, let alone find a middle ground for compromise. Here there have been no resolutions to calm the teaching of history. All the same, Zimmerman argues, the strong American tradition of pluralism has softened the edges of the most rigorous moral and religious absolutism.</p></p><p>Jonathan Zimmerman is Professor of Education and History at the Steinhardt School of Education and in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. He spent two years as a teacher with the Peace Corps in Nepal.Jonathan Zimmerman has written a terrific book. Beautifully written and deeply informed, <i>Whose America?</i> addresses issues in American education, politics and identity that are enormously important. It is the best study yet done of political battles about curriculum, how political horse-trading on all sides has shaped the nature and substance of textbook versions of history, and it has great relevance to debates currently raging about what is taught in schools, in matters of facts and values. On these inflammatory subjects, Zimmerman's even-handed treatment of all sides of these deeply divisive issues is one of the book's great strengths, and offers a lesson in itself to future historians. (Jeffrey Mirel, Professor of Educational Studies and History, University of Michigan)<br><br>Jonathan Zimmerman's provocative book reminds us that the passionately argued "culture wars" in American public schools have a long history in America's public schools. <i>Whose America?</i> illuminates those battles, old and new, with impressive scholarship and story-telling, and deep understanding of the combatants on all sides. (Diane Ravitch, Research Professor, New York University School of Education)<br><br><i>Whose America?</i> is original in its historical argument, thorough in its scholarship, lively in its style, and timely in its subject. It cuts through the polarized rhetoric of the culture wars and shows the virtue of controversy: "debating our differences may be the only thing that holds us together." (David Tyack, Professor of Education and History, Stanford University)<br><br>Zimmerman examines the culture wars that have been fought in America's schools since the Civil War and divides what is commonly held to be one battle into two distinct conflicts, each with its own unique beginnings...By placing these conflicts within their historical context, the author leads readers to a deeper understanding of the issues and how they have influenced and continue to influence public school instruction. [A] landmark piece of scholarship. (Mark Alan Williams <i>Library Journal</i> 2002-08-01)<br><br>Zimmerman argues that the educational wars over religion in the schools and the content of history and social studies courses are separate battles with different stakes, and that the former have been more contentious than the latter. He offers histories of both since the 1920s to illustrate his point and concludes with suggestions about how the religious wars might be resolved. This is a thought-provoking and well-written book...[It] is essential reading for anyone concerned with these issues. (M. Engel <i>Choice</i> 2003-02-01)<br><br>Zimmerman does make a convincing argument. Examples of history textbooks published today substantiate his claim of a diversity coexisting with dullness. So, what exactly does Zimmerman's position mean for the classroom? This book calls for a reexamination of how U.S. history is taught...This call for presenting multiple perspectives in American history classrooms is a timely one.

With some attempt at a systematic listing, but more often at random, he set down an enormous variety of entries from Burke, Montaigne, Madame de Stael, Bacon, Plutarch, Jeremy Taylor, and a host of other writers both famous and obscure, with frequent comments of his own.</p><p>One book contains Emerson's lengthy translations of Goethe, while another is devoted to his brother Charles, who died in 1836, and includes, among other items, excerpts from Charles's letters to his fianc�e. A third contains an interview with a survivor of the battle of Concord and household accounts from the fall and winter of 1835, just after Emerson's marriage to Lydia Jackson.</p><p>Frequent annotations show that Emerson referred to several of these books in composing the sermons he began to give late in 1826, and that many of the entries found their way into his public lectures, into <i>Nature</i>, and into <i>Essays, First Series</i>.

By the 1960s, artists as diverse as Roy Ascott, Hans Haacke, Robert Morris, Sonia Sheridan, and Stephen Willats were breaking with accepted aesthetics to embrace open systems that emphasized organism over mechanism, dynamic processes of interaction among elements, and the observer's role as an inextricable part of the system. Jack Burnham's 1968 <i>Artforum</i> essay &#x201c;Systems Aesthetics&#x201d; and his 1970 &#x201c;Software&#x201d; exhibition marked the high point of systems-based art until its resurgence in the changed conditions of the twenty-first century.</p><p><i>Systems</i> traces this radical shift in aesthetics from its roots in mid twentieth-century general systems theory, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence to the cutting-edge science of the present. The collected texts examine the connections between advanced technological systems, our bodies and minds; the relation of musical to spatial and architectural structures; and the ways in which systems-based art projects can create self-generating entities and networks, alter our experience of time, change the configurations of social relations, cross cultural borders, and interact with threatened ecosystems.</p><p><b>Artists surveyed include <br></b>Roy Ascott, Driessens and Verstappen, David Dunn, Brian Eno, Frank Gillette, Michael Joaquin Grey, Hans Haacke, Helen Mayer Harrison, Newton Harrison, Joan Littlewood, Richard Paul Lohse, Laurent Mignonneau, Manfred Mohr, Nam June Paik, Cedric Price, Casey Reas, Ken Rinaldo, Tom�s Saraceno, Sonia Sheridan, Christa Sommerer, Ubermorgen, Woody and Steina Vasulka, Peter Weibel, Mitchell Whitelaw, John Whitney, James Whitney, Stephen Willats, Iannis Xenakis</p><p><b>Writers include <br></b>Gregory Bateson, Mary Catherine Bateson, Pierre Bourdieu, R.

Is a viable moral theory still possible in the wake of the postmodern criticism of modern philosophy<i>The Order of Evils</i> responds directly to these questions and dilemmas with one simple and brilliant change of focus. Rather than concentrating on the age-old themes of justice and freedom, Adi Ophir offers a moral theory that emphasizes the existential and political nature of evil. Ophir's main contention is that evil is neither a diabolical element residing in the hearts of men nor a meaningless absence of the good. Rather, it is the socially structured order of "superfluous evils." Evils, like pain, suffering, loss, and humiliation, are superfluous when they could have been&#x2015;but were not&#x2015;prevented. Through close analysis of seminal works by modern and postmodern philosophers&#x2015;from Rousseau, Kant, Marx, Sartre, and Arendt to Foucault, Levinas, Derrida, and Lyotard&#x2015;Ophir forges a new perspective for thinking about what it means to be a moral being: to be moral, he argues, is to care for others, and to be committed to preventing, at all costs, their suffering and distress. A theoretically sophisticated work, <i>The Order of Evils</i> also bears the traces of Ophir's own political and personal experiences as an Israeli philosopher and activist. Two major events in recent Jewish history have profoundly influenced his thinking: the Holocaust and the prolonged Israeli domination of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. Ophir does not compare the two events. Instead, he introduces a typology of disasters that allows them to be located within the wide spectrum of humanly generated calamities whose specificity and general patterns emerge clearly and distinctly as what they are and are not.</p></p><p>Adi Ophir is Professor of Philosophy and Political Theory at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. He is the author of <i>The Order of Evils: Toward and Ontology of Morals</i> (Zone Books, 2005) and other books.-- Moshe Halbertal, Department of Philosophy, Hebrew University<br><br>" Ophir presents a well-argued alternative to other philosophical outlooks that ground moral life on basic concepts such as rights, duties or pleasure.

Whyte gives us the opportunity to meet and to see some of them--to <i>really</i> see them. Whyte's portrait of America includes individuals from many walks of life, some still active duty, and from every branch: women and men, old and young, and from a wide swath of ethnicities, befitting our glorious melting pot. From a mayor to an astronaut, from a teacher to a garbage collector, from a business entrepreneur to someone who is homeless, Whyte renders their unique and exceptional lives with great care and gentle brush strokes.</p><p><i>We the People</i> is not only a tour across and through these vast United States, it is a tour through the heart and soul, the duty and the commitment of the people who protect not only our Constitution and our country but our very lives.

Mattern tells the life story of Benjamin Lincoln, a prosperous farmer who left the comfort of his Massachusetts home to become a national hero in America&#39;s struggle for independence. Mattern&#39;s account of the citizen-soldier who served as George Washington&#39;s second-in-command at Yorktown and as secretary at war from 1781 to 1783 revisits the challenges, sacrifices, triumphs, and defeats that shaped Lincoln&#39;s evolution from affluent middle-aged family man to pillar of a dynamic republic. In addition to offering new insights into leadership during the Revolutionary period, Lincoln&#39;s life so mirrored his times that it provides an opportunity to tell the tale of the American Revolution in a fresh, compelling way. Historians generally have been unkind to Lincoln, but Mattern refutes charges that the general was lethargic, corrupt, and ineffective. He points out that Lincoln was one of Washington&#39;s most trusted commanders, displaying courage, energy, and leadership on battlefields as diverse as Saratoga and Savannah, Charleston and Yorktown. Mattern gives a thorough account of all of the general&#39;s military experiences and, of particular interest, offers an unconventional assessment of his failure in one of the most critical episodes of the war - his command of the Southern Department in 1779 and 1780. After charting Lincoln&#39;s wartime fortunes, Mattern chronicles the patriot&#39;s foiled attempts to translate national renown into entrepreneurial success. He tells of Lincoln&#39;s crowning military and political achievement when, in 1786, he was called to arms once more to suppress Shays&#39;sRebellion. Mattern also describes Lincoln&#39;s subsequent election to the lieutenant governorship of Massachusetts - a political career ended by a feud with John Hancock - and his final years of federal service as collector of the port of Boston.</p><p>David B. Mattern is assistant professor on the general faculty at the University of Virginia, and associate editor of The Papers of James Madison.</p><h2>A Christmas Carol</h2><p>A beloved holiday classic follows the transformation of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge, who is visited by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future and reminded of what the true meaning of Christmas is all about.</p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s.

How did a young American of the Depression period decide that he was, of all things, a literary artist? I use the pretentious term literary artist simply to emphasize the contrast between such an ambition and the external facts. A colossal industrial and business center, knocked flat by unemployment, its factories and even its schools closing, decided to hold a World&#x2019;s Fair on the shore of Lake Michigan, with towers, high rides, exhibits, Chinese rickshaws, a midget village in which there was a midget wedding every day, and other lively attractions including whores and con men and fan dancers. There was a bit of gaiety, there was quite a lot of amoebic dysentery. Prosperity did not come back. Several millions of dollars were invested in vain by businessmen and politicians. If they could be quixotic, there was no reason why college students shouldn&#x2019;t be impractical too. And what was the most impractical of choices in somber, heavy, growling, lowbrow Chicago? Why, it was to be the representative of beauty, the interpreter of the human heart, the hero of ingenuity, playfulness, personal freedom, generosity and love. I cannot even now say that this was a bad sort of crackpot to be.<br>The difference between that time and this is that in the Thirties crackpots were not subsidized by their families. They had to go it alone for several years. Or at least until the New Deal (thanks largely to Harry Hopkins) recognized that a great government could buy the solution of any problem and opened WPA projects in many parts of the country. I think it possible that Hopkins and Roosevelt, seeing how much trouble unhappy intellectuals had made in Russia, Germany and Italy between 1905 and 1935, thought it a bargain to pay people twenty-three dollars a week for painting post office murals and editing guidebooks. This plan succeeded admirably. If I am not mistaken, America continued to follow the Hopkins hint in postwar Europe and perhaps in Vietnam.<br>I know, for instance, that John Cheever has been conducting creative writing courses at Sing Sing. Writers and criminals have often found that they had much in common. And correctional officials seem to understand, thanks to the psychology courses they take in the universities, that it is excellent therapy to write books and that it may soften the hearts of criminals to record their experiences. Politicians, too, when they fall from power or retire, become writers or university professors. Thus Hubert Humphrey and Dean Rusk became lecturers, Eugene McCarthy became a poet and an altogether different sort of politician, Spiro Agnew, a novelist. Interviewed not long ago in The New York Times, Mr. Agnew said that, having suffered greatly, he felt the need to do something creative to recover his spirits and was setting to work writing a novel because he was not yet strong enough to do serious mental work.<br>But I started out to recall what it was like to set oneself up to be a writer in the Midwest during the Thirties. For I thought of myself as a Midwesterner and not as a Jew. I am often described as a Jewish writer; in much the same way, one might be called a Samoan astronomer or an Eskimo cellist or a Zulu Gainsborough expert. There is some oddity about it. I am a Jew, and I have written some books. I have tried to fit my soul into the Jewish-writer category, but it does not feel comfortably accommodated there. I wonder now and then whether Philip Roth and Bernard Malamud and I have not become the Hart Schaffner and Marx of our trade. We have made it in the field of culture as Bernard Baruch made it on a park bench, as Polly Adler made it in prostitution, as Two-Gun Cohen, the personal bodyguard of Sun Yat-Sen, made it in China. My joke is not broad enough to cover the contempt I feel for the opportunists, wise guys and career types who impose such labels and trade upon them. In a century so disastrous to Jews, one hesitates to criticize those who believe that they are making the world safer by publicizing Jewish achievements. I myself doubt that this publicity is effective.<br>I did not go to the public library to read the Talmud but the novels and poems of Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser, Edgar Lee Masters and Vachel Lindsay. These were people who had resisted the material weight of American society and who proved&#x2014;what was not immediately obvious&#x2014;that the life lived in great manufacturing, shipping and banking centers with their slaughter stink, their great slums, prisons, hospitals and schools, was also a human life. It appeared to me that this one thing, so intimately known that not only nerves, senses, mind but also my very bones wanted to put it into words, might contain elements that not even Dreiser, whom I admired most, had yet reached. I felt that I was born to be a performing and interpretive creature, that I was meant to take part in a peculiar, exalted game. For there are good grounds to consider this, together with other forms of civilized behavior and ceremony, a game. At its noblest this game is played, under discipline, before God himself&#x2014;so Plato said and others as well. The game can be an offering, a celebration, an act of praise, an acknowledgment also of one&#x2019;s weaknesses and limitations. I couldn&#x2019;t have put it in this manner then. All that appeared was a blind obstinate impulse expressing itself in bursts of foolishness. I loved great things. I thought I had a right to think of that exalted game. I was also extremely proud, ornery and stupid.<br>I was, in 1937, a very young married man who had quickly lost his first job and who lived with his in-laws. His affectionate, loyal and pretty wife insisted that he must be given a chance to write something. Having anyone pay attention to my writing wasn&#x2019;t a real possibility. I am as often bemused as amused at the attention my books have received. Neglect would have been frightful, but attention has its disadvantages. The career of a critic, when I am feeling mean about it, I sometimes compare to that of a deaf man who tunes pianos. In a more benevolent mood I agree with my late father that people must be encouraged to make as honest a living as they can. For this reason I don&#x2019;t object to becoming a topic. When I visited Japan I saw that there were prayer-and-fortune-telling papers sold for a penny at each temple. The buyers rolled up these long strips of paper and tied them by threads to bushes and low trees. From the twigs there dangled hundreds of tightly furled papers. I sometimes compare myself to one of these temple trees.<br>So I sat at a bridge table in a back bedroom of the apartment while all rational, serious, dutiful people were at their jobs or trying to find jobs, writing something. My table faced three cement steps that rose from the cellar into the brick gloom of a passageway. Only my mother-in-law was at home. A widow then in her seventies, she wore a heavy white braid down her back. She had been a modern woman and a socialist and suffragette in the Old Country. She was attractive in a fragile, steely way. You felt Sophie&#x2019;s strength of will in all things. She kept a neat house. The very plants, the ashtrays, the pedestals, the doilies, the chairs revealed her mastery. Each object had its military place. Her apartment could easily have been transferred to West Point.<br>Lunch occurred at half past twelve. The cooking was good. We ate together in the kitchen. The meal was followed by an interval of stone. My mother-in-law took a nap. I went into the street. Ravenswood was utterly empty. I walked about with something like a large stone in my belly. I often turned into Lawrence Avenue and stood on the bridge looking into the drainage canal. If I had been a dog I would have howled. Even a soft howl would have helped. But I was not here to howl. I was here to interpret the world (its American version) as brilliantly as possible. Still I would have been far happier selling newspapers at Union Station or practicing my shots in a poolroom. But I had a discipline to learn at the bridge table in the bedroom.<br>No wonder a writer of great talent and fine intelligence like John Cheever volunteers to help the convicts with their stories. He knows how it feels to be locked in. Maybe he thinks the prisoners, being already locked in, may as well learn the discipline. It is the most intolerable of privations for people whose social instincts are so highly developed that they want to be confined in rooms in order to write novels. Nuns fret not, perhaps, but writers do. Bernanos, the French religious novelist, said that his soul could not bear to be cut off from its kind and that was why he did his work in caf�s. Caf�s indeed! I would have kissed the floor of a caf�. There were no caf�s in Chicago. There were greasy-spoon cafeterias, one-arm joints, taverns. I never yet heard of a writer who brought his manuscripts into a tavern. I have always taken an interest in the fact that Schiller liked to smell apples when he was writing, that someone else kept his feet in a tub of water. The only person whose arrangements seemed to me worth imitating was the mystic and guru Gurdjieff. Gurdjieff, when he had work to do, set forth from headquarters in Fontainebleau with his disciples in several limousines. They carried hampers with caviar, cold fowl, champagne, cheese and fruit. At a signal from the master the cars would stop. They would picnic in a meadow and then, with all his followers around him, Gurdjieff did his writing. This, if it can be arranged, seems to me worth doing.<br>I am glad to say that I can&#x2019;t remember what I was writing in Ravenswood. It must have been terrible. The writing itself, however, was of no importance. The important thing was that American society and S. Bellow came face to face. I had to learn that by cutting myself off from American life in order to perform an alien task, I risked cutting myself off from everything that could nourish me. But this was the case only if you granted the monopoly of nutrients to this business-industrial, vital, brutal, proletarian and middle-class city that was itself involved in a tremendous struggle. It was not even aggressively hostile, saying, &#x201c;Lead my kind of life or die.&#x201d; Not at all. It simply had no interest in your sort of game.<br>Quite often, in the Hudson belonging to J.J., my brother-in-law, my mother-in-law and I drove to the cemetery. There we tended her husband&#x2019;s grave. Her trembling but somehow powerful, spotty hand pulled weeds. I made trips with a Mason jar to the faucet and made water splotches about the nasturtiums and sweet williams. Death, I thought, Chicago-style, might not be such a bad racket after all. At least you didn&#x2019;t have to drive down Harlem Avenue in rush hour back to the house with its West Point arrangements, with its pages of bad manuscript on the bridge table, and the silent dinner of soup and stew and strudel. After which you and your wife, washing dishes, enjoyed the first agreeable hours of the day.<br>J.J., my brother-in-law, born Jascha in the old country, practiced law in the Loop. He was a Republican, member of the American Legion, a golfer, a bowler; he drove his conservative car conservatively and took The Saturday Evening Post; he wore a Herbert Hoover starched collar, trousers short in the ankle, and a hard straw hat in the summer. He spoke in pure Hoosier twang, not like a Booth Tarkington gentleman but like a real Tippecanoe country dirt farmer. All this Americanism was imposed on an exquisitely oriental face, dark, with curved nose and Turkish cheekbones. Naturally a warm-hearted man, he frowned upon me. He thought I was doing something foreign.<br>There was an observable parallel between us. As I was making a writer of myself, this exotic man was transforming his dark oriental traits and becoming an American from Indiana. He spoke of Aaron Slick from Punkin&#x2019; Crick, of Elmer Dub: &#x201c;Ah kin read writin&#x2019;, but ah can&#x2019;t read readin&#x2019;.&#x201d; He had served in the Army&#x2014;my wife wore his 1917 overcoat (too small for me) and J.J. told old, really old La Salle Street Republican sex jokes about Woodrow Wilson and Edith Bolling. It was common in that generation and the next to tailor one&#x2019;s appearance and style to what were, after all, journalistic publicity creations and products of caricature. The queer hunger of immigrants and their immediate descendants for true Americanism has yet to be described. It may be made to sound like fun but I find it hard to think of anyone who underwent the process with joy. Those incompetents who lacked mimetic talent and were pure buffoons were better off&#x2014;I remember a cousin, Arkady, from the Old Country who declared that his new name was now and henceforth Lake Erie. A most poetic name, he thought. In my own generation there were those immigrants who copied even the unhappiness of the Protestant majority, embracing its miseries, battling against Mom; reluctant, after work, to board the suburban train, drinking downtown, drinking on the club car, being handed down drunk to the wife and her waiting station wagon like good Americans. These people martyred themselves in the enactment of roles that proved them genuine&#x2014;just as madly wretched in marriage as Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd. Cousin Arkady, a clown who sold dehydrated applesauce on the road, giving dry applesauce demonstrations to housewives in small-town department stores, was spared the worst of it. He simply became &#x201c;Archie&#x201d; and made no further effort to prove himself a real American.<br>The point of this brief account, as I see it, is to evoke that mixture of imagination and stupidity with which people met the American Experience, that murky, heavy, burdensome, chaotic thing. I see that my own error, shared with many others, was to seek sanctuary in what corners of culture one could find in this country, there to enjoy my high thoughts and to perfect myself in the symbolic discipline of an art. I can&#x2019;t help feeling that I overdid it. One didn&#x2019;t need as much sanctuary as all that.<br>If I had to name the one force in America that opposes the symbolic discipline of poetry today as much as brutal philistinisms did before World War II, I would say the Great Noise. The enemy is noise. By noise I mean not simply the noise of technology, the noise of money or advertising and promotion, the noise of the media, the noise of miseducation, but the terrible excitement and distraction generated by the crises of modern life. Mind, I don&#x2019;t say that philistinism is gone. It is not. It has found many disguises, some highly artistic and peculiarly insidious. But the noise of life is the great threat. Contributing to it are real and unreal issues, ideologies, rationalizations, errors, delusions, nonsituations that look real, nonquestions demanding consideration, opinions, analyses in the press, on the air, expertise, inside dope, factional disagreement, official rhetoric, information&#x2014;in short, the sounds of the public sphere, the din of politics, the turbulence and agitation that set in about 1914 and have now reached an intolerable volume.<br>Nadezhda Mandelstam, writing of poets in the Soviet Union, says of the Russian noise: &#x201c;Nowhere else I believe were real people so much deafened as they were here by the din of life&#x2014;One after another poets fell silent because they could no longer hear their own voices.&#x201d; She adds: &#x201c;The noise drowned out thought and, in the case of millions, conscience as well.&#x201d; William Wordsworth, nearly two hundred years ago, had expressed his concern over the effects of modern turbulence on poetry. He was right too. But in the language of my youth&#x2014;&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t know the half of it.&#x201d;<br><br></p></p><h2>Psychology and the Challenges of Life: Adjustment and Growth</h2><p>In the 12th edition of <i><b>Psychology and the Challenges of Life: Adjustment and Growth</b></i>, authors Jeffrey Nevid and Spencer Rathus continue to reflect on the many ways in which psychology relates to the lives we live and the important roles that psychology can play in helping us adjust to the many challenges we face in our daily lives.

Pindar&#39;s victory odes have the reputation of being complex and allusive in their language and reference. In this much-needed commentary on seven of the extant odes, Professor Willcock aims to open up Pindar&#39;s poetry to a wider readership by starting with a short and straightforward poem and progressing by level of difficulty to one of the greatest. The book begins with an introduction that includes sections on Pindar&#39;s life and on his thought, language and style, but that pays particular attention to the genre of the victory ode and its conventions.</p><p>The Greek lyric poet Pindar is renowned for poems celebrating athletic victories in the great games of Olympia, Delphi, Corinth and Nemea.

All four were English knights&#x2015;ancestors of Sir Ranulph Fiennes&#x2015;and part of the army of England's King Henry V. Across the valley, four sons of the French arm of the Fiennes family were confident that the Dauphin's army would win the day . . . <p>Sir Ranulph Fiennes explains how his own ancestors were key players through the centuries of turbulent Anglo-French history that led up to Agincourt, and he uses his experience as expedition leader and soldier to give us a fresh perspective on one of the bloodiest periods of medieval history.</p><p>With fascinating detail on the battle plans, weaponry, and human drama of Agincourt, this is a gripping evocation of a historical event integral to English identity.

In 1993 Her Majesty the Queen awarded Fiennes the Order of the British Empire (OBE) because, on the way to breaking these historic records, he has raised over twenty millions dollars for charity. In 2003 he ran seven marathons in seven days on seven continents in aid of the Heart Foundation. In 2009 he became the oldest Briton to reach the summit of Everest.&#x201c;Fiennes provides a unique perspective of medieval history as a direct ancestor of nobility that fought for both the English and French at Agincourt.

Now, Rosenberg&#x2019;s artful translation restores what has been left aside: the essence of imaginative creation in the Bible.<br><br>In <i>A Literary Bible</i>, Rosenberg presents for the first time a synthesis of the literary aspect of the Hebrew Bible showing how, when, and by whom the various books of the Bible were written, and allowing the reader to experience each book in discrete and contemporary idiom, as if it were written in modern times. <br><br>Beautifully rendered, Rosenberg's meticulous translation is a significant addition to the understanding of the greatest narrative of all time one that is sure to be loved by laypeople and religious scholars alike.</p><p>"David Rosenberg is one of the great visionary thinkers of our time."<br>--Robert Polito, Director of the New School Writing Program, FORAWhen Rosenberg first came to the Hebrew Bible, he did so convinced that he could interpret it within modern academic theory. Very quickly, he encountered voices so vibrant that they swept away such theoretical pretensions and set him on the daunting lifetime task of translating these voices into authentic vernacular English. The culmination of more than 30 years of labor, this impressive volume combines portions of 18 biblical books&#x2014;from Genesis through Ezra&#x2014;restoring to each passage the irresistible creativity and individuality of its now-forgotten author. Whether in the tautly engaging prose narrative of Exodus and Samuel or the strikingly direct poetic imagery of Isaiah and Job, readers feel an insistent human presence defying the barriers of time and culture. Though diverse in tone and mood, these translations deliver the force of minds for whom faith lives as something more than dry orthodoxy. Beyond the brilliant translations, the supplementary commentaries will reward readers disappointed by typical treatments of a dynamic ancient culture. A truly fresh reading of seminal scriptural texts. --Bryce Christensen</p><h2>Bebop: The Music and Its Players</h2><p>"When bebop was new," writes Thomas Owens, "many jazz musicians and most of the jazz audience heard it as radical, chaotic, bewildering music." For a nation swinging to the smoothly orchestrated sounds of the big bands, this revolutionary movement of the 1940s must have seemed destined for a short life on the musical fringe. But today, Owens writes, bebop is nothing less than "the lingua franca of jazz, serving as the principal musical language of thousands of jazz musicians." <br> In <em>Bebop</em>, Owens conducts us on an insightful, loving tour through the music, players, and recordings that changed American culture. Combining vivid portraits of bebop's gigantic personalities with deft musical analysis, he ranges from the early classics of modern jazz (starting with the 1943 Onyx Club performances of Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, Oscar Pettiford, Don Byas, and George Wallington) through the central role of Charlie Parker, to an instrument-by-instrument look at the key players and their innovations. Illustrating his discussion with numerous musical excerpts, Owens skillfully demonstrates why bebop was so revolutionary, with fascinating glimpses of the tempestuous jazz world: Thelonious Monk, for example, did "everything 'wrong' in the sense of traditional piano technique....Because his right elbow fanned outward away from his body, he often hit the keys at an angle rather than in parallel. Sometimes he hit a single key with more than one finger, and divided single-line melodies between two hands." In addition to his discussions of individual instruments and players, Owens examines ensembles, with their sometimes volatile collaborations: in the Jazz Messengers, Benny Golson told of how his own mellow saxophone playing would get lost under Art Blakey's furious drumming: "He would do one of those famous four-bar drum rolls going into the next chorus, and I would completely disappear. He would holler over at me, 'Get up out of that hole!'"<br> In this marvelous account, Owens comes right to the present day, with accounts of new musicians ranging from the Marsalis brothers to lesser-known masters like pianist Michel Petrucciani. <em>Bebop</em> is a jazz-lover's dream--a serious yet highly personal look at America's most distinctive music.<br></p><p>In Bebop, Owens conducts us on an insightful, loving tour through the music, players, and recordings that changed American culture.

The series quickly became the most widely circulated newspaper story of the era. And the <i>Sun</i> , a brash working-class upstart less than two years old, had become the most widely read newspaper in the world. </p><p> Told in richly novelistic detail, <i>The Sun and the Moon</i> brings the raucous world of 1830s New York City vividly to life the noise, the excitement, the sense that almost anything was possible. The book overflows with larger-than-life characters, including Richard Adams Locke, author of the moon series (who never intended it to be a hoax at all); a fledgling showman named P.T. Barnum, who had just brought his own hoax to New York; and the young writer Edgar Allan Poe, who was convinced that the moon series was a plagiarism of his own work. </p><p>An exhilarating narrative history of a city on the cusp of greatness and a nation newly united by affordable newspapers, <i>The Sun and the Moon</i> may just be the strangest true story you've ever read.</p></p><p><b>Matthew Goodman</b>&#x2019;s nonfiction writing has appeared in <i>The Forward</i> , <i>The American Scholar</i> , <i>Harvard Review</i> , <i>Brill&#x2019;s Content</i> , and <i>The Utne Reader</i> . He is the author of <i>Jewish Food: The World at Table</i> . He lives in Brooklyn with his wife and children.New Yorkers like to think of themselves as sophisticates, but in the summer of 1835 they were anything but. An elaborate hoax, perpetrated by NEW YORK SUN editor Richard Adams Locke, tricked them into believing that the moon is inhabited by animals such as unicorns and four-foot-tall talking &#34;man-bats.&#34; Narrator Malcolm Hillgartner&#39;s rich baritone works well with a story that could almost be fiction but isn&#39;t. His slightly melodramatic reading lends a certain tone of irony to the book, keeping the listener aware that while this is factual history, it&#39;s based on a big joke. This entertaining book gives an interesting glimpse of the early days of newspapers in New York City and how trusting and gullible readers were, once upon a time.

She identifies what people need from each other, and how practitioners can help clients recognize, bear and direct their need for others. The Space Between Us presents a vocabulary for understanding human relationships, not in the traditional negative framework of depAndence and codepAndence, but in terms of the essential ways in which these connections make us whole.Rather than merely giving advice on how to improve a marriage or other romantic attachment, psychologist Josselson ( Finding Herself ) explores eight types of relationships, from the deeply intimate to the very casual. Although some people may be most adept at one type of interaction, all such relationships are important to our growth as caring human beings, she states. Each chapter closes with a short life history of a person interviewed by the author, with particular attention paid to how the type of relationship discussed shaped that person?to avoid psychobabble? . Visual diagrams chart these men's and women's relationships throughout their lives. Additional chapters cover how the sexes differ in the way they relate to others and the various forms that love can take. Deep and insightful, this should prove important to professional therapists as well as to those seeking a better understanding of human nature. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Study Guide to Accompany Our Global Environment: A Health Perspective</h2><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This ISBN is a Study Guide.

Rosie is fleeing an unspeakable loss that has left her homesick for her family. As she awkwardly grasps for the words to communicate with and connect to Nicole, the cool, distant, and beautifully polished mother of the three children she cares for, Rosie&#x2019;s bond with the patriarch of the household develops almost too naturally. When Lola, the middle child, begins to suspect an indecent intimacy between Rosie and her father, Rosie moves to the south of France to care for Nicole&#x2019;s elderly guardian, the storyteller of the family&#x2019;s secrets. There, she discovers a past darkened by war and duplicity, and finally comes to understand the tragedy behind Nicole&#x2019;s elusive demeanor.</p><p>The act of writing a first novel has a lot in common with being an au pair. Each is often accomplished by a young, overeducated woman who believes she is the center of the universe. This can make for dull reading, and sometimes for unattended children falling down staircases. But Lily King's fine first novel--about an au pair--neatly avoids the solipsism that often plagues coming-of-age stories. In <i>The Pleasing Hour</i>, 19-year-old Rosie has fled New Hampshire for France after undergoing an anguishing loss: she surrendered her newborn son to her infertile, married sister. Rosie is literally hollowed out, unable to see beyond her own pain. "Nothing in my body felt right. It seemed to be ringing with pain but there was no part of me that I could point to and tell her, Here, here's where it hurts."<p> In Paris she moves in with the Tivots: the unassuming, shambling father, Marc; the glamorous and unforgiving mother, Nicole; the beautiful daughter, Odile; the merry daughter, Lola; the momma's boy, Guillaume. Rosie steps into the highly polarized atmosphere of the Tivot household, unconsciously upsetting its equilibrium by throwing in her lot with Marc and Lola. And when the family heads off to Spain for vacation, the power balance shifts palpably, since Rosie is the only one who speaks Spanish. Even Nicole grudgingly admires her. What's more, Rosie notices Marc regarding her with the "relentless curiosity he'd had in his eye since we landed in Spain." On Mallorca, the two consummate their relationship, and the betrayal forces her to see beyond her own worries to the entrenched pains and allegiances of her host family.</p><p> King cleverly iterates this message in her narrative. She occasionally, deliberately, allows each member of the Tivot family to voice the story, and this opening-up of the narrative allows the world to flow into a novel whose themes might otherwise seem petty. In the end, the author doesn't perpetrate the dull crime of youthful self-involvement--she comments on it. We care for Rosie from the start, but we like her a lot more as she comes alive to the people around her. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Lily King studied at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Syracuse University, where she won the Raymond Carver Prize for fiction.

A native of Mobile, Alabama, she lives with her husband and son in San Francisco.1<br><br>I come to on a Cessna, bumping through the air. My head is throbbing, and there is blood on my shirt. I have no idea how much time has passed. I look at my hands, expecting to see restraints, but there are none. Just an ordinary seatbelt looped around my waist. Who strapped me in? I don&#x2019;t even remember boarding the plane.<br><br>Through the open door of the cockpit, I see the back of the pilot&#x2019;s head. It&#x2019;s just the two of us. There is snow in the mountains, wind buffeting the plane. The pilot seems completely focused on his controls, shoulders tense.<br><br>I reach up and touch my head. The blood has dried, leaving a sticky mess. My stomach rumbles. The last thing I ate was the French toast. How long ago was that? On the seat beside me, I find water and a sandwich wrapped in wax paper. I open the bottle and drink.<br><br>I unwrap my sandwich&#x2014;ham and Swiss&#x2014;and take a bite. Shit. My jaw hurts too much to chew. Someone must have punched me in the face after I hit the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;Are we going home?&#x201d; I ask the pilot.<br><br>&#x201c;Depends on what you call home. We&#x2019;re headed to Half Moon Bay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t tell you anything about me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First name, destination, that&#x2019;s about it.

Till death do us part.&#x201d; He turns back just long enough to give me a look that warns me not to ask any more questions.<br><br>We hit an air pocket so hard my sandwich goes flying. An urgent beeping erupts. The pilot curses and frantically pushes buttons. He shouts something to air traffic control. We&#x2019;re descending fast, and I&#x2019;m clutching the armrests, thinking of Alice, going over our final conversation, wishing I&#x2019;d said so many things.<br><br>Then, suddenly, the plane levels out, we gain altitude, and all appears to be well. I gather the pieces of my sandwich from the floor, wrap the whole mess back up in the wax paper, and set it on the seat beside me.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry for the turbulence,&#x201d; the pilot says.<br><br>&#x201c;Not your fault.

It&#x2019;s two p.m. on a weekday, so she&#x2019;s probably embroiled in a thousand meetings. I don&#x2019;t want to bother her, but I really need to see her.<br><br>A text reply arrives. Where are you?<br><br>Back in HMB.<br><br>Will leave in 5.<br><br>It&#x2019;s more than twenty miles from Alice&#x2019;s office to Half Moon Bay. She texts about traffic downtown, so I order food, almost the whole left side of the menu. The caf� is empty. The perky waitress in the perfectly pressed uniform hovers. When I pay the check, she says, &#x201c;Have a good day, Friend.&#x201d;<br><br>I go outside and sit on a bench to wait. It&#x2019;s cold, the fog coming down in waves. By the time Alice&#x2019;s old Jaguar pulls up, I&#x2019;m frozen. I stand up, and as I&#x2019;m checking to make sure I have everything, Alice walks over to the bench. She&#x2019;s wearing a serious suit, but she has changed out of heels into sneakers for the drive. Her black hair is damp in the fog. Her lips are dark red, and I wonder if she did this for me. I hope so.<br><br>She rises on her tiptoes to kiss me. Only then do I realize how desperately I&#x2019;ve missed her. Then she steps back and looks me up and down.<br><br>&#x201c;At least you&#x2019;re in one piece.&#x201d; She reaches up and touches my jaw gently. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not sure.&#x201d;<br><br>I wrap my arms around her.<br><br>&#x201c;So why were you summoned?&#x201d;<br><br>There&#x2019;s so much I want to tell her, but I&#x2019;m scared. The more she knows, the more dangerous it will be for her. Also, let&#x2019;s face it, the truth is going to piss her off.<br><br>What I&#x2019;d give to go back to the beginning&#x2014;before the wedding, before Finnegan, before The Pact turned our lives upside down.<br><br>2<br><br>I&#x2019;ll be honest&#x2014;the wedding was my idea. Maybe not the location, the place, the food, the music, all the things Alice knew how to do so well. The idea, though, that was mine. I&#x2019;d known her for three and a half years. I wanted her, and marriage was the best way to ensure I didn&#x2019;t lose her.<br><br>Alice didn&#x2019;t have a good track record with permanence. In her earlier days, she was wild, impulsive, sometimes drawn too quickly to a fleeting, shining object. I worried that if I waited too long, she would be gone. The wedding, if I&#x2019;m honest, was simply a means to permanence.<br><br>I proposed on a balmy Tuesday in January. Her father had died, and we were back in Alabama. He&#x2019;d been her final living relative, and his unexpected death shook her in a way I hadn&#x2019;t seen before. We spent the days after the funeral cleaning out Alice&#x2019;s childhood home in a Birmingham suburb. In the mornings, we went through boxes in the attic, work space, and garage. The house was filled with artifacts of her family life: her father&#x2019;s military career, her dead brother&#x2019;s baseball exploits, her dead mother&#x2019;s recipe books, faded pictures of her grandparents. It was like an archaeological treasure trove of a small, long-forgotten tribe from a lost civilization.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the last one,&#x201d; she said. Not in a pitiful way, just matter-of-fact. She&#x2019;d lost her mother to cancer, her brother to suicide. She had survived, but not unscathed. Looking back, I can see that her position as the only living member of the family made her more loving and reckless than she might have been otherwise. Had she not been so alone in the world, I&#x2019;m not sure she would have said yes.<br><br>I&#x2019;d ordered her engagement ring weeks earlier, and it arrived via UPS moments after she learned of her father&#x2019;s death. I&#x2019;m not sure why, but I slipped the box into my duffel bag as we were leaving for the airport.<br><br>Two weeks into the trip, we called a real estate agent and had him come out to appraise the house. We wandered through the rooms, the agent taking notes, scribbling frantically, like he was preparing for a test. At the end, we stood on the porch, waiting for his assessment.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you sure you want to sell?&#x201d; the agent asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Alice said.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that&#x2014;&#x201d; He gestured toward us with his clipboard. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you stay? Get married. Have kids. Build a life. This town needs families. My children are so bored. My boy has to play soccer because we don&#x2019;t have enough kids to field a baseball team.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Alice said, looking out toward the street, &#x201c;because.&#x201d;<br><br>That was it. &#x201c;Because.&#x201d; The guy snapped back into real estate mode. He suggested a price, and Alice suggested a slightly lower one. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s below market value for this neighborhood,&#x201d; he said, surprised.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. I just want it over with,&#x201d; she replied.<br><br>He jotted a notation on his clipboard. &#x201c;It will certainly make my job easier.&#x201d;<br><br>Within hours, a truck pulled up, guys got out, and the house was stripped of the worn furniture and aging appliances. All that remained were two lounge chairs beside the pool, which hadn&#x2019;t changed since the day it was dug and plastered in 1974.<br><br>The following morning, a different truck arrived with different men&#x2014;stagers hired by the realtor. They loaded a whole new set of furniture into the house. They moved quickly and with confidence, putting large abstract paintings on the walls and small shining knickknacks on the shelves. When they were finished, the house was the same, only different: cleaner, sparser, devoid of the pesky items that give a home its soul.<br><br>The day after that, a parade of real estate agents led a pride of potential buyers through the rooms, all whispering, opening cabinets and closets, studying the sheet that provided the listing details. That afternoon, the agent called with four offers, and Alice accepted the highest. We packed our things, and I made reservations for a flight back to San Francisco.<br><br>In the evening, when the stars came out, Alice wandered outside to stare at the night sky and say goodbye to Alabama for good. It was a warm night, the scent of barbecues wafting up over the back fence. The outdoor lamps reflected brilliantly off of the pool, and the lounge chairs felt as comfortable as they must have been the first day her father dragged them out onto the patio, when his wife was beautiful and tan and his children were small and rambunctious. I sensed that this was as good as Alabama could get, and yet Alice seemed so sad, immune to the beauty that had snuck up on us without warning.<br><br>Later, I would tell our friends that the idea to seize that moment to propose came as an impulse. I wanted to make her feel better. I wanted to show her that there was a future. I wanted to bring her happiness on such a mournful day.<br><br>I walked out to the pool, knelt down, removed the ring from its box, and presented it to Alice in my sweaty palm. I didn&#x2019;t say a word. She looked at me, she looked at the ring, she smiled.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>3<br><br>Our wedding was held in a pasture along the banks of the Russian River, a two-hour drive north of San Francisco. Months earlier, we&#x2019;d gone out there to take a look at it. We drove right past it a couple of times, because it wasn&#x2019;t marked from the road. When we opened the gate and walked down the path toward the river, Alice hugged me and said, &#x201c;I love it.&#x201d; At first, I thought she was joking. In places, the grass was five feet high.<br><br>The property was a huge, meandering dairy farm, with cows roaming the pasture. It was owned by the rhythm guitar player from Alice&#x2019;s first band. Yes, she was in a band, and it&#x2019;s even possible you&#x2019;ve heard their music, though we can talk about that later.<br><br>The day before the wedding, I drove right past the site again. This time, though, it was because it looked completely different. The guitar player, Jane, had spent weeks cutting, shaping, and resodding the pasture. It was amazing. It looked like a fairway from the world&#x2019;s most perfect golf course. The grass moved up over the hill, then sloped down to the river. Jane said that she and her wife had been looking for a project.<br><br>There was a large tent, a patio, a pool, and a modern pool house. A stage rose above the river shore, and a gazebo stood on a mound overlooking all of it. The cows still wandered around in their slow, meditative way.<br><br>Chairs were brought in, tables, equipment, speakers, and umbrellas. While Alice wasn&#x2019;t exactly keen on weddings, she loved parties. Although we hadn&#x2019;t had one in the years I&#x2019;d known her, I heard stories. Big shindigs in ballrooms, at beaches, in her past apartments; apparently it was a talent she possessed. So when it came to the arrangements, I stepped aside and let her do her thing. Months of planning, everything perfect, everything timed just right.<br><br>Two hundred people. It was supposed to be one hundred for me, one hundred for her, though in the end it was a bit lopsided. It was a funny guest list, like any wedding. My parents and grandmother, partners from my wife&#x2019;s firm, co-workers from the clinic where I used to work, former clients, friends from college, graduate school, Alice&#x2019;s old music friends, an off-kilter combination of others.<br><br>And Liam Finnegan and his wife.<br><br>They were the last to be invited, 201 and 202 on the guest list. Alice had met him three days before the wedding, at the law firm where she&#x2019;d been working day and night for the past year. I know, it&#x2019;s weird, my wife is a lawyer. If you knew her, it would surprise you too. And we can also talk about that, but later. The important part here is Finnegan&#x2014;Finnegan and his wife, Liam and Fiona, guests 201 and 202.<br><br>At the firm, my wife had been the junior associate on Finnegan&#x2019;s case. It was an intellectual property thing. Finnegan was a businessman now. Years earlier, however, he was a well-known front man for an Irish folk rock group. You&#x2019;ve probably never heard his music, but maybe you&#x2019;ve seen his name. It&#x2019;s been in all of those British music magazines&#x2014;Q, Uncut, Mojo. Dozens of musicians claim him as a key influence.<br><br>For days after Alice got the assignment, we had Finnegan&#x2019;s discs on repeat in our house. The case was as straightforward as an intellectual property case can be. A young band had stolen a section of one of his songs and turned it into a huge hit. If you&#x2019;re like me and don&#x2019;t understand music on a technical level, you wouldn&#x2019;t see the similarities, but if you&#x2019;re a musician, my wife said, the theft was obvious.<br><br>The case resulted from a comment Finnegan had made a few years earlier. He told an interviewer that the band&#x2019;s hit sounded suspiciously like a song from his second album. He didn&#x2019;t plan to take it any further, but then the young band&#x2019;s manager sent Finnegan a letter demanding that he apologize for the comment and publicly declare the song had not been stolen. Things devolved from there, ultimately leading to my wife working a million hours on her first big case.<br><br>As I said, she was the junior associate, so when the judgment came back in Finnegan&#x2019;s favor, the partners took all the credit. A month later, the week before our wedding, Finnegan paid a visit to the firm. He had been awarded an insane amount of money, far more than he wanted, certainly more than he needed, so he wanted to thank everyone for their work. When he arrived, the partners led him to a conference room, where they regaled him with tales of their incredible strategy. At the end, he thanked them, but then asked if he could meet all the people who had really worked on the case. He cited a couple of the briefs and motions, surprising the partners with the level of attention he had paid to the finer details.</p><h2>Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen</h2><p>Based on a rich array of sources that capture the voices of both political leaders and ordinary Americans, <em>Uncle Sam Wants You</em> offers a vivid and provocative new interpretation of American political history, revealing how the tensions of mass mobilization during World War I led to a significant increase in power for the federal government. Christopher Capozzola shows how, when the war began, Americans at first mobilized society by stressing duty, obligation, and responsibility over rights and freedoms. But the heated temper of war quickly unleashed coercion on an unprecedented scale, making wartime America the scene of some of the nation's most serious political violence, including notorious episodes of outright mob violence. To solve this problem, Americans turned over increasing amounts of power to the federal government. In the end, whether they were some of the four million men drafted under the Selective Service Act or the tens of millions of home-front volunteers, Americans of the World War I era created a new American state, and new ways of being American citizens.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher Capozzola</strong> is an Associate Professor of History at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br><br>"This book demonstrates the singular significance of America's brief but crucial experience with modern war in 1917 and 1918."--Michael S. Neiberg, <em>The Journal of American History</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"But do you want Uncle Sam? Capozzola's fresh history of the American past is a bracing challenge to the American present--and future."--James Carroll, author of <em>House of War</em><p></p><br>"Capozzola does an excellent job of rendering the jingoistic, dogmatic mindset that characterized the country at a crucial time...All this the author captures in eloquently rendered and assiduously researched detail."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"A well crafted and important work that adds critical depth to the historical understanding of this transformative period of American history. Capozzola convincingly argues that during World War I the power of the state grew at the expense of citizens' rights."--Andrew Wiest, <em>History: Reviews of New</em> <em>Books</em><p></p><br>"A sharp sense of irony and dry wit undergird this eloquent history of how Americans remade their understanding of the relationship between state and citizen in the crucible of World War I. We now live with the massive structures of state power that were first constructed then; we share many of that generation's obligations and anxieties. Can we learn from their mistakes?"--Linda K. Kerber, author of <em>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies: Women and the Obligations of Citizenship</em><p></p><br>"<em>Uncle Sam Wants You</em> immerses readers in one of the formative moments of the twentieth century, when the fervent production of war-time loyalty collided with much weaker voices of civil liberties and dissent. In an eloquent blend of historical narrative and political theory, Capozzola pursues the question: what can the state legitimately demand of its citizens? This is a powerfully told and eye-opening history whose implications will bring readers right up to the present."--Daniel T. Rodgers, author of <em>Atlantic Crossings: Social Politics in a Progressive Age</em><p></p><br>"The stresses of wartime inevitably change a society, both in the short and the long term. Christopher Capozzola's <em>Uncle Sam Wants You</em> brilliantly illuminates the powerful and often unnoticed impact of World War I on American culture. By so doing, it sheds essential light on contemporary controversies that will affect the United States for years to come."--Geoffrey R. Stone, University of Chicago<p></p><br>"Capozzola brings politics into social history, and paints a more vivid picture of the pervasiveness of wartime repression than has so far been available...[R]eaders are unlikely to find a fresher, more substantial exploration of the repressive atmosphere of World War I anytime soon."--<em>The History</em> <em>Teacher</em><p></p><br>"You will gain many fresh insights by reading Capozzola's finely nuanced study about how the domestic impact of the war did and did not change the conception of what it meant to be an American citizen."--Michael E. Parrish, <em>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</em><p></p><br>"Capozzola succeeds in bringing political theory to the ground level. Engaged writing style and compelling analysis will make the book useful in advanced undergraduate and graduate history, political science, and political theory courses alike."--Beatrice McKenzie, <em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"Capozzola writes with a vividness and verve. Essential reading not just for experts in the period but for anyone interested in the broader themes of American history, especially those wanting to learn about the development of its political culture."--Steven Casey, <em>War in History</em><p></p><br>"Readers of Capozzola's book will be struck by the stark contrasts concerning US participation in the Great War and the current war on terror."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"Subtle, complex, and remarkably balanced. A very well-written book on a period of American history just now starting to get the scholarly attention it deserves. A book all historians of modern America should not only be familiar with, but be able to enjoy reading as well."--Mark E.

But on another it is a comprehensive exploration of the moral dilemmas facing young women in the choices they have to make about their lives. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel. This edition, first published in 2006, takes as its copytext the second edition of 1813, which corrects some errors of the first edition.

In <em>The Art of Teaching</em>, writer and critic Jay Parini looks back over his own decades of trials, errors, and triumphs, in an intimate memoir that brims with humor, encouragement, and hard-won wisdom about the teacher's craft.<br> Here is a godsend for instructors of all levels, offering valuable insight into the many challenges that educators face, from establishing a persona in the classroom, to fostering relationships with students, to balancing teaching load with academic writing and research. Insight abounds. Parini shows, for instance, that there is nothing <em>natural</em> about teaching. The classroom is a form of theater, and the teacher must play various roles. A good teacher may look natural, but that's the product of endless practice. The book also considers such topics as the manner of dress that teachers adopt (and what this says about them as teachers), the delicate question of politics in the classroom, the untapped value of emeritus professors, and the vital importance of a settled, disciplined life for a teacher and a writer. Parini grounds all of this in personal stories of his own career in the academy, tracing his path from unfocused student--a self-confessed "tough nut to crack"--to passionate writer, scholar, and teacher, one who frankly admits making many mistakes over the years.<br> Every year, thousands of newly minted college teachers embark on their careers, most with scant training in their chosen profession. <em>The Art of Teaching</em> is a perfect book for these young educators as well as anyone who wants to learn more about this difficult but rewarding profession.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jay Parini</strong> is Axinn Professor of English at Middlebury College. He has written five books of poetry, six novels, and three biographies, and was editor of <em>The Columbia History of American Poetry</em> and <em>The Norton Book of American Autobiography</em>. His writings have appeared in <em>The New York Times Book</em> <em>Review, Harper's, TLS</em>, and <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em>. He lives in Weybridge, Vermont.<br><br>"This warm guide should inform, entertain, and inspire young teachers as they seek to 'waken a student to his or her potential.'"--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A charming reflection on 30 years devoted to learning.... Parini offers a number of tips in a manner that is decidedly laid back, friendly and casual--in much the same way, one surmises, that he teaches his own classes."--<em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"To read one of these short essays is like taking a walk with a genial, generous and intelligent teacher who speaks fluently and kindly. The book probably ought to be considered as a sequence of such walks, designed to bring pleasure and some profit, too, to all, but particularly to young teachers entering the field."--<em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"What he writes about teaching will be of keen interest to all educators, especially young ones just finding their way in the profession.... Parini has thought deeply about all aspects of teaching, and readers will appreciate his insights on such sundry topics as assessment (he believes teaching to the test is 'anti-educational'); dress (it reflects one's teaching style); and the hiring of new colleagues (people you have to be prepared to work with for the next 20 years). Parini's book may not change the way you teach, but it may make you think more deeply about education than you ever have before."--<em>Education Week</em><p></p><br>"[A] combination memoir and advice book, the tale of a shy, working-class kid from Scranton, Pa., who gradually discovered that he loved to read and write, and that he was happiest when he could pass along that love to young students.... When he zeroes in on the passions that animate good teachers, and the nuts and bolts of running a lecture course or a seminar, the book takes wing."--William Grimes, <em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"Parini, an English professor at Middlebury College, shares his quiet wisdom on guiding students toward the pleasures of critical thinking. Equal parts memoir, essay, and practical advice, Parini's handbook for the writer who teaches is a gentle, elegant tribute to those who turn the life of the mind into a performance art."--<em>Utne Reader</em><p></p><br>"Practical and philosophical, ardent and lucid, Parini covers the nitty-gritty of teaching, explains how writing is nurtured by teaching and vice versa, and discusses why teaching students to think critically not only about books but also about the world around them is so very crucial."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"One pleasing aspect of <em>The Art of Teaching</em> is Parini's candor about professorial anxiety, similar to the stage fright that afflicts some longtime actors."--<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"Writes with economy, clarity and passion. He argues that part of a professor's work is to challenge students' assumptions. He has done the same for readers with this good book."--<em>The Charlotte Observer</em><p></p><br>"An eloquent and humane vision of our most vital human resource--teaching and its role in our civilization. Written with a poet's elegance, <em>The Art of Teaching</em> is part memoir and part personal and practical reflection on what it means to be in the classroom with students. A seasoned teacher and writer, Parini gives us a remembrance of great teachers who changed his life and of how writing and scholarship come together to make teaching better and richer. This book is also a reflection on the dynamic relationship between teachers and students, academic colleagues old and young and the important community they all create when they come together on a college campus. In an age when the pursuit of money and the God of materialism threatens to swallow America whole, Parini reminds us that the intellectual and human values that happen in the classroom are our most important preparation for life." --Peter Balakian, author of <em>Black Dog of Fate</em><p></p><br>"Jay Parini, novelist, poet, biographer, and editor, has now given us an extremely readable and useful book about teaching, drawing upon his decades in the classroom on both sides of the desk. Aptly titled, <em>The Art of Teaching</em> is itself artful in its well-measured, outspoken, and entertaining look at a subject not enough explored and therefore the more welcome." ---William Pritchard, Professor of English at Amherst College, and author of <em>Shelf Life: Literary Essays and Reviews</em><p></p><br>"In discussing his own lecturing, Isaiah Berlin said he was 'fumbling for the light switch in a very large but very dark room.' Parini switches on lights, and if he does not make all the darkness visible, he illuminates much of the mystery of teaching and shows us all how to do better. Parini is a fine writer and a superb teacher. He blends inspiration with practical advice--describing, for example, the classroom as theater. Jettison all those heavy volumes on methodology and read this small book. Read with a pencil and mull, and you will become a better teacher, and maybe a better person. What a friend teachers have in Parini!" --Sam Pickering, author of <em>Waltzing the Magpies</em> and <em>The Best of Pickering</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Locating Lost Family Members &amp; Friends: Modern Genealogical Research Techniques for Locating the People of Your Past and Present</h2><p>Provides instructions for locating lost family members on the Internet, and demonstrates how to overcome research obstacles</p><p>Kathleen W.

Conceptual Mathematics, Second Edition, introduces the concept of &#39;category&#39; for the learning, development, and use of mathematics, to both beginning students and general readers, and to practicing mathematical scientists. The treatment does not presuppose knowledge of specific fields, but rather develops, from basic definitions, such elementary categories as discrete dynamical systems and directed graphs; the fundamental ideas are then illuminated by examples in these categories.</p><p>Conceptual Mathematics introduces the concept of category to beginning students, general readers, and practicing mathematical scientists based on a leisurely introduction to the important categories of directed graphs and discrete dynamical systems. The expanded second edition approaches more advanced topics via historical sketches and a concise introduction to adjoint functors.F.

Containing additions and corrections to the first edition, the book is a simple statement of how to do the job and is particularly suitable for reservoir/production engineers as well as those associated with hydrocarbon recovery. This practical book approaches the basic limitations of reservoir engineering with the basic tenet of science: Occam&#39;s Razor, which applies to reservoir engineering to a greater extent than for most physical sciences - if there are two ways to account for a physical phenomenon, it is the simpler that is the more useful. Therefore, simplicity is the theme of this volume.

Zweigenhaft is Dana Professor of Psychology at Guilford College, where he chairs the social science division and directs the communications concentration. G. William Domhoff is a Research Professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. They have coauthored four books together: Jews in the Protestant Establishment (1982), Blacks in the White Establishment: A Study of Race and Class in America (1991), Diversity in the Power Elite: Have Women and Minorities Reached the Top? (1998), and Blacks in the White Elite: Will the Progress Continue? (2003).Zweigenhaft and Domhoff tell a profound sociological story about how the American elite has managed to accommodate successfully to growing societal diversity. Newcomers are allowed in, but they are changed in the process of entering: hence, the contemporary elite is no longer made up exclusively of white Christian men, but its members still share perspectives and values that favor narrow class interests regardless of where they came from. This powerful account demonstrates how a system of inequality can adapt to the pressure for social change. For today's diverse America, the old axiom, "plus �a change," will need to be translated into many more languages.

He lives on Staten Island, New York.Expert historian and librarian at the Statue of Liberty Monument and Ellis Island since 1988, Moreno has crafted the first comprehensive reference book about one of America's most familiar symbols. Offering entries from "Edmond Fran ois Valentin About," friend of Auguste Bartholdi (who sculpted the Statue of Liberty) to "Zoaves," the colorfully attired Civil War soldiers who marched through Manhattan in the statue's inaugural parade in 1886, this work is an intriguing compendium of photographs, facts, and statistics that purports to answer every conceivable question on this beloved monument. Each page is beautifully illustrated with reproductions of paintings, drawings, posters, cartoons, photographs, and documents integral to the statue's history, many of which are published here for the first time. (Although the illustrative material is identified, the source of the material is not.) Information in one entry encourages browsing in related entries, and there are many cross references. This work is full of fascinating facts. For instance, most readers are unaware that the model for the statue was Bartholdi's mother, Charlotte, or that the statue almost went to Boston. No separate bibliography is included, but the narrative under the entry "Literature" gives a brief, chronological history of major publications focusing on the Statue of Liberty or individuals closely allied with her, such as Bartholdi, Edouard de Laboulaye, or Gustave Eiffel. The extraordinary breadth of topics covered weaves a story of more than just a monument; the cultural and ideological circumstances of our nation are clearly and compellingly presented.

He died in 1930.<br><br>ANDREW LYCETT is the author of critically acclaimed biographies of Muammar Qaddafi, Ian Fleming, Rudyard Kipling, Dylan Thomas, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Wilkie Collins.<i>Excerpted from the introduction</i><br> &nbsp;<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br> Struck down by the flu, a friend of mine felt so awful that he was forced to drag himself to bed for a couple of days. There was nothing he wanted to do. Any movement was painful, any printed word was a blur. Then he picked up an old copy of Sherlock Holmes stories, and, as he began to focus, the pages seemed to turn as if by magic, and his condition perceptibly improved. &#x2018;They are perfect comfort reading,&#x2019; he told me. &#x2018;Well-written, ingenious and full of fascinating detail. I simply couldn&#x2019;t put them down.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was in fact reading the collected stories of Sherlock Holmes. There are fifty-six, originally published in serial form in the Strand Magazine and later gathered in five books &#x2013; <i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i> (1892), <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes </i>(1894), <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i> (1905), <i>His Last Bow</i> (1917), and <i>The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes</i> (1927). But there are also four Sherlock Holmes novels which, despite their greater length, would certainly have served the same therapeutic need, since they are just as intriguing as the stories. <i>They are A Study in Scarlet</i> (1887), <i>The Sign of Four</i> (1890), <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> (1901&#x2013;02) and <i>The Valley of Fear</i> (1914&#x2013;15) &#x2013; the first three of which are included here. Each has its special role in the evolution of the Canon, as dedicated &#x2018;Sherlockians&#x2019; call the combined stories and novels. And it was in a novel &#x2013; <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> &#x2013; that the detective made his first outing in print. His character is subsequently fleshed out in another novel, <i>The Sign of Four</i>. He only surfaces in story form as a running serial in the new Strand Magazine in 1891. Then, after becoming a national phenomenon over the next two and a half years, he was rudely killed off by his creator, Arthur Conan Doyle, who wanted to do other things &#x2013; only to resurface eight years later in another novel, <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i>, which is often regarded as the perfect Sherlock Holmes package, combining absorbing detective work, astute social observation, and blood-tingling horror.<br> &nbsp;<br> The world&#x2019;s most famous detective was conceived in turbulent times in the mid-1880s, when, following the failure of the expedition to rescue General Gordon from the Mahdi&#x2019;s forces in Khartoum, Britain was coming to terms with one of the first obvious reverses in its steady colonial expansion. At the time Conan Doyle was working as a general practitioner in South-sea, a genteel suburb of Portsmouth. Despite the peacefulness of his surroundings, he was experiencing his own internal upheavals. He had trained as a doctor at Edinburgh University, where the empirical tradition of the &#x2018;Athens of the North&#x2019; had made a strong impression on the Roman Catholicism of his birth. He had begun to see himself as a scientist and, to the horror of his deeply religious family, to call himself agnostic. Nevertheless, the struggle between scientific truth and his deep spiritual yearning stayed with him. While a young doctor, the former strand predominated, as he tried to maintain a properly objective approach to all around him. But, as he grew older, his belief in the afterlife could not be restrained and he became the world&#x2019;s leading advocate of spiritualism.<br> &nbsp;<br> He retained a good sense of humour throughout, and he liked to joke that his single-handed practice in Bush Villas, Southsea, positioned between a pub and a Pentecostal chapel, acted as a buffer between two very different kinds of opiates. While working as a family doctor, he indulged his more speculative side by writing stories for national magazines. Like many authors, his output reflected the popular genres of his era, so, despite his scientific bent, his tales tended to have fantastical or even occult themes. One of the most successful, &#x2018;J. Habakuk Jephson&#x2019;s Statement&#x2019;, was published in the influential <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> in January 1884. Loosely based on the last voyage of the Mary Celeste, this story was compared by critics with the work of Edgar Allan Poe. It was followed over the next few months by &#x2018;John Barrington Cowles&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Great Kleinplatz Experiment&#x2019;, two more stories with plots involving mesmerism.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the same time he was seeking a publisher for a more ambitious novel, <i>The Firm of Girdlestone</i>, about the life and loves of an Edinburgh medical graduate working for a corrupt London trading concern. But he met with little success &#x2013; to the extent that he saw fit to note privately that he knew of no man in &#x2018;so sad a position as he who is gifted with some amount of literary ability which is just short of the market value. How he toils and slaves to get into the magic circle and what dreary heart-breaking work it is.&#x2019; Uncharacteristically for a generally positive and good-natured man, he even speculated about writing &#x2018;The Autobiography of a Failure&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> In August 1885 his luck seemed to change when he married Louise Hawkins, the sister of one of his patients. She brought a renewed sense of purpose to his life. &#x2018;After my marriage,&#x2019; he wrote in his autobiography <i>Memories and Adventures</i>, &#x2018;my brain seems to have quickened and both my imagination and my range of expression were greatly improved.&#x2019; And he was now more determined than ever to get his name &#x2018;on the back of a volume&#x2019;. He decided to go about this by writing a detective story, which was the latest genre to capture the public imagination. The British public had long been fascinated by crime, devouring the &#x2018;true stories&#x2019; of criminals which appeared in <i>The Newgate Calendar</i> from the 1770s. But its interest in detectives was more recent, following the formation of the Metropolitan Police in London in 1829, and its detective branch thirteen years later. With his journalist&#x2019;s eye for topicality, Charles Dickens had been intrigued by the exploits of this branch&#x2019;s Inspector Jack Whicher and had written them up in his magazine <i>Household Words</i>. One of his employees there was his friend and fellow novelist Wilkie Collins, author of <i>The Moonstone</i>, published in 1868, and later described by T. S. Eliot as &#x2018;the first and greatest English detective novel&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> Actually there had been several forerunners. Edgar Allan Poe had blazed the trail with a sleuth called C. Auguste Dupin in his story &#x2018;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&#x2019; in 1841. Dupin was not a fully paid-up detective, but his skill lay in deciphering clues through a process of &#x2018;ratiocination&#x2019;. Although detectives subsequently appeared in other books (one example is Clara Vaughan in R. D. Blackmore&#x2019;s eponymous novel in 1864), the genre took a leap forward in 1866 when the French journalist Emile Gaboriau invented a policeman detective called Monsieur Lecoq and invited his readers to share in the process of solving various crimes. Conan Doyle had been observing these developments, for he later wrote, &#x2018;Gaboriau had rather attracted me by the neat dovetailing of his plots, and Poe&#x2019;s masterful detective, M. Dupin, had from boyhood been one of my heroes. But could I bring an addition of my own?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> His solution was to cast his mind back to his student days and, in particular, to his former professor of surgery, Joseph Bell, who was known for his remarkable powers of observation and deduction. Bell had a knack of being able to look at his patients and determine not only their medical ailments, but also their whole life story. As the professor himself put it, the basis of &#x2018;all successful medical diagnosis&#x2019; was &#x2018;the precise and intelligent recognition and appreciation of minor differences&#x2019;. Thus his rationale for working out that one of his patients had recently served as a non-commissioned officer in a Highland regiment stationed in Barbados: &#x2018;The man was a respectful man, but did not remove his hat. They do not in the army, but he would have learned civilian ways had he been long discharged. He has an air of authority and he is obviously Scottish. As to Barbados, his complaint is elephantitis, which is West Indian and not British.&#x2019; Conan Doyle wondered to himself, &#x2018;If he [Bell] were a detective he would surely reduce this fascinating but unorganized business to something nearer to an exact science. I would try if I could get this effect.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> He was beginning to see how he could build on Dupin&#x2019;s &#x2018;ratiocination&#x2019; and create a detective who brought a real scientific approach to his work. Another of his university mentors had been Sir Robert Christison, who had pioneered the use of forensics in criminal enquiries (notably in the trial of the notorious &#x2018;body-snatchers&#x2019; Burke and Hare in 1828, when his experiments into the bruising of corpses helped secure Burke&#x2019;s conviction after Hare had turned King&#x2019;s evidence). Christison was also known for trying out on himself new drugs derived from vegetable alkaloids &#x2013; a practice Conan Doyle himself followed, as would his fictional creation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Conan Doyle was keen to show how the process of criminal investigation was becoming more scientific. It was a quarter of a century since Sir William Herschel, a magistrate in Bengal, had noted that every person&#x2019;s fingers had a configuration of ridges and furrows which was unique to them and could be used to help combat fraud. The fingerprinting techniques which he had trialed in India were starting to be used in Britain. Meanwhile on the continent the Frenchman Alphonse Bertillon had invented &#x2018;anthropometrics&#x2019;, which tried to describe criminals and even predict their behaviour on the basis of precise body measurements. Conan Doyle would adopt such methodology for his own sleuth who, in &#x2018;The Adventure of the Naval Treaty&#x2019;, praises &#x2018;the Bertillon system of measurements&#x2019; and expresses &#x2018;his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> Having decided to give his detective a scientific approach, Conan Doyle turned to his story and characters. His earliest name for his work was <i>A Tangled Skein</i>, but his notebooks show that he soon replaced this with the more melodramatic <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>. Before long he was contemplating a &#x2018;consulting detective&#x2019; with the unpromising name of Sherrinford Holmes, whose story would be told by Ormond Sacker, his room-mate at 221B Upper Baker Street. In some early notes, Conan Doyle sketched out some familiar features for Holmes. He was a &#x2018;sleepy eyed young man&#x2019;, a &#x2018;philosopher&#x2019;, and a collector of rare violins, who had access to his own chemical laboratory. Sacker was a less defined personality: someone who had seen military service abroad &#x2013; originally in Sudan, where General Gordon had recently met his death at the hand of the Mahdists in Khartoum, though later, as it turned out, for the internal chronology of the story, in Afghanistan.<br> &nbsp;<br> Within a short time these two main characters had evolved into Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson. At the start of <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>, Dr Watson is in London, having been invalided back from Afghanistan following an injury at the battle of Maiwand. Needing a place to live, he learns from Stamford, his old dresser at St Bartholomew&#x2019;s Hospital, of a man who is looking for someone to share his rooms. Stamford warns that his friend, Sherlock Holmes, is taciturn and &#x2018;a little queer in his ideas&#x2019;, with a &#x2018;passion for definite and exact knowledge&#x2019; that verges on cold-bloodedness. When Holmes is later introduced to Watson, he is working in a small laboratory in a corner of the hospital, trying to find a new way of detecting blood stains which he says will come to be known as the Sherlock Holmes test. His first remark to Watson is straight out of the Joseph Bell textbook &#x2013; &#x2018;How are you? You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.&#x2019; &#x2013; and he later details the clues which have led him to this conclusion. Watson discovers another side to this curious figure when he goes to live with him in Baker Street. Holmes proves to be a neurotic workaholic who can only relax when he plays his violin. At times he falls into a stupor, staring at the world with such &#x2018;a dreamy, vacant expression&#x2019; that Watson thinks he must be addicted to some drug, which indeed turns out to be true.<br> &nbsp;<br> Conan Doyle started writing <i>A Study in Scarlet</i> on 8 March 1886 and finished by the end of April. He despatched his manuscript, which ran to just over 43,000 words, or approximately 200 pages, to the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, which had published &#x2018;J.Habakuk Jephson&#x2019;s Statement&#x2019; and looked kindly on his work. By then the story had been fleshed out. After two chapters setting the scene at Baker Street, Conan Doyle developed a clunky, if always vivid, tale about a gruesome murder in South London, where the victim, Enoch Drebber, is found in a room smeared with blood spelling the word RACHE (meaning &#x2018;revenge&#x2019; in German). Using a magnifying glass and a tape measure, Holmes gets a good idea of the man who committed the murder. However, after Drebber&#x2019;s secretary, Joseph Strangerson, is also found dead, the story flashes back to Salt Lake Valley in Utah and the early years of the Mormon religion, which clearly fascinated Conan Doyle. Both murdered men had been prominent members of the Mormon church, otherwise known as the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints. They had tried to use their seniority to prise a young girl from her fianc�, Jefferson Hope. When she is forcibly married to Drebber, Hope vows revenge which he is finally able to take, after tracking Drebber and Strangerson to London, and himself taking a job as a cabby.<br> &nbsp;<br> Holmes works this out without too much trouble. However, the story was rather crudely divided into two halves &#x2013; the murder investigation in London and the earlier historical saga set among the Mormon community in Utah (a backdrop that borrowed heavily from <i>The Dynamiter</i> written by Robert Louis Stevenson and his wife Fanny only the previous year). As a result A Study in Scarlet did not prove easy to place. By Conan Doyle&#x2019;s own admission, it took a &#x2018;circular tour&#x2019; of several publishing houses, before Ward, Lock and Company, which specialized in cheap, sensational fiction, came up with an offer in September. This was only �25 which Conan Doyle found insulting, particularly as they were demanding the full copyright. But, not being in much of a bargaining position, he was forced to accept. As he pointedly noted in his autobiography, this was the only money he ever received for a work which became an instant success when it finally saw the light of day a year later in the publisher&#x2019;s popular <i>Beeton&#x2019;s Christmas Annual.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> The book edition of the story followed in July 1888, after which Conan Doyle started to gain more recognition as an author. He was particularly delighted when, in February 1889, <i>Micah Clarke</i>, his novel about the Monmouth rebellion, was published by Longmans. He had always regarded historical novels as a particularly exalted branch of literature (which explains why he spent so much time on the early history of the Mormons in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>). As a result of this and other items in print, he found himself f�ted in literary circles in London. While dining with the critic Andrew Lang, who rated him highly, at the Savile Club, he met the novelist Walter Besant who had recently set up the Society of Authors. In August 1889 he was un...</p><h2>Mathematical Models In Biology</h2><p>The major aim of this book is to present instances of interaction between two major disciplines, biology and mathematics. The goal has been that of addressing a fairly wide audience. Biology students will find this text useful as a summary of modern mathematical methods currently used in modelling, and furthermore, applied mathematics students may benefit from examples of applications of mathematics to real-life problems. As little background as possible has been assumed throughout the book: prerequisites are basic calculus so that undergraduate students, as well as beginning graduate students, will find most of the material accessible.</p><p>This book is an introduction for readers interested in biological applications of mathematics and modeling in biology, showing how relatively simple mathematics can be applied to a variety of models. Despite the great advances that have taken place, the simple lessons described in the text are still important and informative.Leah Edelstein-Keshet is a member of the Mathematics Department at the University of British Columbia and past president of the Society for Mathematical Biology.

The practice of doubling enabled Elizabethan dramatists to surround their principal characters with a host of lesser Lords, Soldiers, Messengers and Servants.

A desk job in London gives him the chance of reconciliation with his former wife. Then, in Yugoslavia, as a liaison officer with the partisans, Crouch becomes finally and fully aware of the futility of a war he once saw in terms of honor.<br><br> <i>Unconditional Surrender</i> is the third novel in Waugh's brilliant Sword of Honor trilogy recording the tumultuous wartime adventures of Guy Crouchback, which also comprises <i>Men at Arms </i>and<i> Officers and Gentlemen</i>.</p><p>Evelyn Waugh (1903-1966), whom <i>Time</i> called "one of the century's great masters of English prose," wrote several widely acclaimed novels as well as volumes of biography, memoir, travel writing, and journalism. Three of his novels, <i>A Handful of Dust, Scoop, </i>and<i> Brideshead Revisited,</i> were selected by the Modern Library as among the 100 best novels of the twentieth century."The quality of the writing is, throughout, superb, and confirms my belief that Mr. Waugh is the best living writer of English prose."&#x2015;<b>Bernard Bergonzi</b>, <b><i><em>Guardian</em></i></b><br><br>"What <em>Parade's End</em>, Ford Madox Ford's great work, was to World War I, Evelyn Waugh's 'Sword of Honour' trilogy is to World War II."&#x2015;<b>Herbert A.

Starting with basic geometric ideas, <i>Differential Geometry</i> uses basic intuitive geometry as a starting point to make the material more accessible and the formalism more meaningful. The book presents topics through problems to provide readers with a deeper understanding. And, it introduces hyperbolic geometry in the first chapter rather than in a closing chapter as in other books. An important reference and resource book for any reader who needs to understand the foundations of differential geometry.</p><p></p><h2>Scenarios: The Art of Strategic Conversation</h2><p>Scenario planning allows companies to move away from linear thinking and better understand external change. Eight years (and 30,000 copies) after publication <i>Scenarios</i> is still acknowledged as the definitive work in the field. Now, Kees van der Heijden brings his bestseller up to date, following up on his original case studies and adding significant new material. The <i>Second Edition</i> changes focus slightly by providing more in-depth analysis and application of the concept of the 'strategic conversation'. While maintaining the underlying rigour of the first edition, van der Heijden revisits the text to make it far more practical and accessible, and in doing so gives you the tools you need to set out and negotiate a successful future course for your organization in the face of significant uncertainty.</p><p>This book shows how to use scenarios--a powerful new approach to strategic planning--to pilot your company profitably through unknown territory. First developed at Royal Dutch/Shell, scenario planning is a technique that enables you to imagine--and prepare for--discontinuous change. When initially developed, scenario planning helped companies understand external change--change in markets, the competitive arena, technology, demographics and so on. In this book, the author takes the art of senario planning one giant step further. After tackling external forces, he shows you how to apply the logic of scenario planning to internal forces. When applied internally as well as externally, scenarios become the driving force for learning as well as planning.The 'one perfect solution' does not exist. The world is too uncertain for that. But a solution that <b>will</b> work for you is out there, waiting to be discovered. <p>For many years now, certainly since Scenarios was first published, the only constants in the business environment have been turbulence and change. Today things are no different.</p> <p>Scenario planning enables managers to face up to this uncertainty by evolving from the idea of finding the &#x2018;best strategy&#x2019; to one of mobilising the &#x2018;best strategizing process&#x2019;. In this long-awaited new edition of his bestselling classic, Kees van der Heijden shows you how to move your organization to meet the future by turning its ongoing &#x2018;strategic conversation&#x2019; to its own advantage. Linking your organization&#x2019;s unique (but often tacit) business idea with scenario thinking, and building on the principles of organizational learning, he describes practical ways to develop those skills that will enhance the continuous scenario-based strategy process.</p> <p><i>"Kees van der Heijden has written the most comprehensive, detailed and insightful guide to understanding the business enviornment in a way most useful to business. No one has mastered the art of bringing that insight to bear in the real world of business with greater depth than Kees." <b>Peter Schwartz, Chairman, Global Business Network; author of 'The Art of the Long View'.</b></i></p> <p><i>"The span of this book is unusually wide: it goes from the philosophy of scenario thinking to the minute practicalities of how to do it. This book is, in my view, the best field guide in a field where it is easy to go astray and where guidance is precious." <b>Pierre Wack, Former Head of Scenario Planning, Royal Dutch / Shell</b></i></p></p><h2>Strategic Thinking in Criminal Intelligence</h2><p>Drawing on the expertise of some of the foremost practitioners and academics in the area of strategic criminal intelligence from both the UK and Australia, this text addresses the way that law enforcement agencies establish their priorities in the face of a dynamic and complex criminal environment.</p><p>Strategic Thinking in Criminal Intelligence is a work which should be considered by practitioners, policy makers and readers with an interest in law enforcement. When law enforcement agencies are continually under pressure to deliver more with even fewer resources, the field of strategic criminal intelligence has a role to play in the reduction, detection and prevention of crime. - Law Institute Journal(Victoria), March 2010 Reviews of the previous edition:Strategic Thinking in Criminal Intelligence promotes the idea that the collective use of effective strategic planning in law enforcement is an important component of the intelligence cycle which may lead to the promotion of a &#34;... stable political, civil and economic environment domestically and internationally.&#34; ... [It] is a collection of chapters by leading strategic intelligence analysts from across the global law enforcement community. Although the text is primarily aimed as a tool of reference for intelligence officers and researchers there is a loud warning resonating from the book. As a result of advanced technology available to both the good guys and the bad guys this text invites the reader to think about how the good guys can best stay one step ahead of the bad guys or be better prepared when inevitable international criminal activity happens. - NSW Police News, Vol 84(4), April 2004 The book is structured as a seamless synthesis of the theoretical and practical operational aspects of criminal intelligence. ... The book carves out a prominent niche for strategic crime intelligence in the edifice of law enforcement. The models prescribed advocate a strong, centralised intelligence effort, at the same time calling upon the local enforcers to gear up their operational and tactical capabilities. The articles are not only aimed at filling in the present intelligence gap and filling the existing vacuum, but also present models of perspective planning for the foreseeable future. This dimension gives us some valuable tips on the current thinking on the shape of things to come. The existing literature on this vital area is scarce, inadequate and surprisingly under-researched until recently. In this respect, the book under review is actually a pioneering effort, which makes it a must-read for the decision makers and policy planners in the area of law enforcement. Some of the presentations are quite theoretical, treating the project as a management exercise and analysing the complex interplay of the factors involved, which significantly impact the outcome. However, these articles, when juxtaposed with the actual experiences of the existing operating models in the UK and Australia, bring out the practical wisdom of the theoretical drill. While the developed countries continue their research and experimentation on their criminal intelligence models, their experiences provide us with enriching insights, which could be a great help in evolving our own long overdue criminal intelligence mechanism. Senior decision makers - both in the bureaucracy and the police - will find this book an extremely valuable tool to understand the complexities of the problem and devise an efficacious criminal intelligence apparatus best suited to our needs and requirements. - Amit Varma IPS, Criminal Investigation Department Review, August 2004, 26 With contributions from both Australia and the United Kingdom, this is an interesting and well written study that should appeal to anyone involved in intelligence gathering and analysis within police circles. - Thames View, No 30, December 2005</p><h2>Physiology - An Illustrated Review (Thieme Illustrated Reviews)</h2><p><p><strong><em>The perfect study tool - packed with key information and full-color illustrations!</em></strong></p><p>The perfect study tool for preparing for your courses or examinations - <em>Physiology - An Illustrated Review</em>'s focused presentation and full-color illustrations makes learning the complex information essential to success easier.

It is the attitude of Dowell, his puzzlement, uncertainty, and the seemingly haphazard manner of his narration that make the book so powerful and mysterious. Despite its catalogue of death, insanity, and despair, the novel has many comic moments, and has inspired the work of several distinguished writers, including Graham Greene. This is the only annotated edition available.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.</p><p>First published in 1915, Ford Madox Ford's <i>The Good Soldier</i> begins, famously and ominously, "This is the saddest story I have ever heard." The book then proceeds to confute this pronouncement at every turn, exposing a world less sad than pathetic, and more shot through with hypocrisy and deceit than its incredulous narrator, John Dowell, cares to imagine. Somewhat forgotten as a classic, <i>The Good Soldier</i> has been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.<p> Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.</p><p> Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: "If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did." Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. "Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions," John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Ford Madox Ford wrote The Good Soldier, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><h2>Business Statistics</h2><p><p> <i>For two-semester business statistics courses.</i> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Relevant statistical methods that empower individuals to make effective, data-informed business decisions</b> </p> <p> <b> <i>Business Statistics,</i> </b> <b> 4th Edition</b> <i>,</i> by Sharpe, De Veaux, and Velleman<i>,</i> narrows the gap between theory and practice, by covering relevant and real-life statistical methods that help business students make good, data-driven decisions.

It presents an integrated framework that is designed to help them analyze, prioritize, and then solve these problems. With this &#34;Big Picture&#34; approach, they?ll gain a better understanding of how they affect and are affected by the decisions that are made. This leads to stronger, more effective marketing in the long run.</p><p>Marketers are responsible for constructing much of the cultural landscape in which we live. It is virtually impossible to look around without experiencing a logo, a selling line or a product placement in print, radio, TV or Internet Advertising. As a consumer and citizen I may bemoan the state of a world in which billboards are more ubiquitous than trees, but as a marketing professional I have come to recognize this new landscape as a museum of carefully plotted marketing plans. As consumers, we are exposed to as many as 5,000 commercial messages each day. As marketers, we can see each of these exposures as an opportunity to learn from other marketers, thus improving our own skills."The Big Picture is the most valuable tool in my b-school toolbox. I've used it not only in marketing classes, but in strategy classes, entrepreneurship classes, and even finance, because it really helps me ask the right questions and stucture my thinking. Perhaps most importantly, it is a tool that is going to give me an edge when I leave school and start my career as a management consultant" <p>-Jesse Marmon, Kellogg MBA 2003</p></p><h2>Bad Kids: Race and the Transformation of the Juvenile Court (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)</h2><p>Within the past three decades, social and legal changes have transformed the juvenile court from a nominally rehabilitative welfare agency into a second-class criminal court for young offenders. Recent efforts to "toughen" juvenile justice policies have resulted in increasingly harsh sanctions that fall disproportionately on minority youths. In this provocative new book, Barry Feld examines what went wrong with the juvenile court and proposes an alternative model for youth crime control and child welfare. <br><br>The Progressive reformers who created the juvenile court a century ago saw children as relatively blameless and innocent. But recent decades of rising crime rates associated with urban decay have strained this tolerant view of young offenders. Feld relates the 1967 Supreme Court decision <em>In re</em> <em>Gault</em> to the broader social and legal changes associated with the civil rights movement and the Warren Court's "Due Process Revolution." Although <em>gault</em> mandated more elaborate procedural safeguards in delinquency hearings, ironically, those protections legitimated the imposition of more punitive sanctions. <br><br>Since <em>Gault</em>, Feld argues, three decades of judicial, legislative, and administrative reforms have conducted a form of "criminological triage." At the "soft end," reforms have shifted noncriminal status offenders, primarily female and white, out of the juvenile justice system into a "hidden system" made up of private sector mental health and chemical dependency facilities. At the "hard end," states transfer increasing numbers of young offenders, disproportionately minorities, to criminal court for prosecution as adults. Meanwhile, juvenile courts punish more severely those delinquents-again disproportionately minorities-who remain within the increasingly criminalized juvenile justice system.<br><br> Feld attributes the current state of affairs to a conceptual flaw inherent in the juvenile court. The juvenile justice system attempts to combine social welfare and social control functions in one organization, but inevitably fulfills both missions badly because of the inherent and irreconcilable contradictions between them. Progressive reformers situated the juvenile court on a number of cultural, legal, and criminological fault lines, where the ideas of child and adult, determinism and free will, immature and responsible, treatment and punishment collide. The past three decades have witnessed a shift from the former to the latter of these binary pairs in response to the racial transformation of cities, the increase in serious youth crime, and the erosion of the rehabilitative assumptions of the juvenile court. <br><br> The solution, Feld argues, is to uncouple social welfare from criminal social control. States could try all offenders in one integrated criminal justice system with appropriate modifications to accommodate the youthfulness of younger defendants: a graduated, age-culpability sentencing system, separate youth correctional facilities, and the like. Formally recognizing youthfulness as a mitigating factor would provide youths with greater protections and justice than they currently receive in either the juvenile or criminal justice systems. At the same time such a strategy would enable public policies to address directly the social welfare needs of all young people.<br></p><p><br><strong>Barry Feld</strong> is Centennial Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School. He has written five books and more than three dozen law review and criminology articles on juvenile justice administration with specil emphases on serious offenders, procedural justice, and youth sentencing policy.<br>This is the latest title in Oxford's "Studies in Crime and Public Policy" series, much of which deals with youth crime and its relationship to society. Feld (Minnesota Law Sch.) is a leading scholar in the field of juvenile justice administration. Here he briefly traces the evolution of the juvenile court from its inception in the early 1900s, with an emphasis on the past three decades. Early juvenile courts were seen as rehabilitative welfare agencies, but with the Supreme Court's emphasis in the 1960s on due process, children began to be seen as defendants. As a result of a series of Supreme Court decisions, Feld asserts, juveniles now receive the "worst of both worlds." He explores the complex relationship between race and youth crime in an attempt to understand the court decisions that lead to procedural justice. He also discusses the recent political impetus to treat juveniles as adults in some cases. His points are well made and persuasive.
